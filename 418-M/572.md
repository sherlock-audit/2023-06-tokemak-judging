# Slow reaction to the market condition due to the filter's high alpha
## Summary

The stats/calculators contracts operate based on obsoleted market information or slow data, which can have adverse effects leading to losses to the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Dex Fee Alpha is currently hardcoded to 10%, and the snapshot is hardcoded to be performed daily (every 24 hours).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/stats/Stats.sol#L12

```solidity
File: Stats.sol
08: library Stats {
09:     uint256 public constant SECONDS_IN_YEAR = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60;
10:     uint256 public constant DEX_FEE_APR_SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL = 24 * 60 * 60; // daily
..SNIP..
12:     uint256 public constant DEX_FEE_ALPHA = 1e17; // 0.1; must be less than 1e18
```

When a snapshot is triggered on each day, the `_snapshot` function will be executed:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/stats/calculators/base/CurvePoolNoRebasingCalculatorBase.sol#L165

```solidity
File: CurvePoolRebasingCalculatorBase.sol & CurvePoolNoRebasingCalculatorBase.sol & BalancerStablePoolCalculatorBase.sol
186:     /// @notice Capture stat data about this setup
187:     /// @dev This is protected by the STATS_SNAPSHOT_ROLE
188:     function _snapshot() internal override {
..SNIP..
216:         uint256 newFeeApr;
217:         if (feeAprFilterInitialized) {
218:             // filter normally once the filter has been initialized
219:             newFeeApr = Stats.getFilteredValue(Stats.DEX_FEE_ALPHA, feeApr, currentFeeApr);
```

Line 219 above translates to the following formula:

$$
newFeeApr = (oldFeeAPR \times 0.9) + (currentFeeApr \times 0.1)
$$

Assume that the APR of an LP Token drops from 10% to 1% during a black swan event or major security incident at the DEX/protocol.

The following simulation attempts to determine how long it takes for the calculator to return the intrinsic/correct APR of 1% after the event. The interval between each change is 24 hours, as the snapshot can only be triggered once daily.

The above chart shows that it takes almost a month for the calculator to return the intrinsic/correct APR of 1% after the event. Thus, the existing filter makes the calculator too slow to react to changes in APR. 

The issue is aggravated by the fact that the `DEX_FEE_ALPHA` and `DEX_FEE_APR_SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL` are hardcoded in the contracts, so there is no way to update these values to speed up the reaction to market conditions after deployment.

## Impact

The purpose of the stats/calculators contracts is to store, augment, and clean data relevant to the LMPs. When the solver proposes a rebalance, the strategy uses the stats contracts to calculate a composite return (score) for the proposed destinations. Using that composite return, it determines if the swap is beneficial for the vault. 

If it operates based on obsoleted market information or slow data, it can result in detrimental consequences that lead to losses to the protocol, such as false signals allowing the unprofitable rebalance to be executed OR unaware of a sudden market downturn, resulting in not selling off a declining asset in time.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The purpose of the filter is to smooth out the sharp increase or decrease in the APR over a period of time and to avoid any potential manipulation. 

Consider making the filter alpha and snapshot period adjustable instead of hardcoding them so that the time to react to changes can be optimized over time.
