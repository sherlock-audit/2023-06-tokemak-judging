# A user can have one of their stakes overwritten
## Summary

A user can have one of their lockups overwritten

## Vulnerability Detail

The function stake allows a user to stake their GPTokens. It does some checks and then pushes the stake to an arrays called lockups

```solidity

 lockups[to].push(Lockup({ amount: uint128(amount), end: uint128(end), points: points }));

```

When a user calls the function unstake, it takes the lockupId passed in by the user and deletes it from the array 

```solidity

  delete lockups[msg.sender][lockupId];

```

https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L145-L146

The problem here is that when an element is deleted from an array, it is not really deleted, the value is set to its default value, which  this case is 0.

This creates the following dangerous scenario

1. User stakes and the lockupId is set to 0

2. User stakes again and the lockupId is set to 1 

3. User unstakes the second lockup (set to 1), and instead of deleting it, it is set to the same lockupId as the first stake which is 0, overwriting and losing the first stake.






This can cause a massive and unexpected loss of funds though normal use of the protocol



## Impact

A user can have one of their lockup stakes overridden, causing a loss of funds
