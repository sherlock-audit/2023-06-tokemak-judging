# Users sometimes will not be able to withdraw funds due to logical error

## Summary
Sometimes users will not be able to withdraw their funds when there is a 
## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever users withdraw their assets, there will be this code executed. Lets look at `info.totalAssetsToPull - Math.max(info.debtDecrease, info.totalAssetsPulled)` it will prevent users to spend more than their debt and pulled assets.
There is a check `info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull` pulled assets is no more than assets to pull, but there is no the same check for `debtDecrease` which will sometimes lead to reverting transaction when there is a price drop instead ending loop and sending funds to the user
 
```solidity
          (uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) = _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
              destVault,
              shares,
// no overflow check for info.debtDecrease like it's done for info.totalAssetsPulled
              info.totalAssetsToPull - Math.max(info.debtDecrease, info.totalAssetsPulled), 
              totalVaultShares
          );
          if (sharesToBurn == 0) {
              continue;
          }

          uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
          uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));

          info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
          info.totalAssetsPulled += assetPulled;
          info.debtDecrease += totalDebtBurn;

          if (info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull) { //------ @audit no check that info.debtDecrease > info.totalAssetsToPull
              info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;
              info.totalAssetsPulled = info.totalAssetsToPull;
              break;
          }

## Recommendation
Implement the same check for `info.debtDecrease` like `info.totalAssetsPulled`
