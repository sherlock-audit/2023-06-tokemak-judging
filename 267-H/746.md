# Vault uses outdated data for share price calculation
## Summary
`updateDebtReporting` modifies `totalAssets` (idle & debt). `totalAssets` is used in the vault's share price calculation. Unless it's called right before the calculation, the vault will use outdated data.

## Vulnerability Detail
`updateDebtReporting()` updates `idle` and `debt` which combined represent the vault's `totalAssets`. `totalAssets` is used to calculate the share price:

```sol
    /**
     * @dev Internal conversion function (from assets to shares) with support for rounding direction.
     */
    function _convertToShares(uint256 assets, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();

        // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
        shares = (assets == 0 || supply == 0) ? assets : assets.mulDiv(supply, totalAssets(), rounding);
    }

    /// @dev Internal conversion function (from shares to assets) with support for rounding direction.
    function _convertToAssets(uint256 shares, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 assets) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        assets = (supply == 0) ? shares : shares.mulDiv(totalAssets(), supply, rounding);
    }
```

Given that:
- totalSupply = 95e18
- totalAssets = 100e18
- amountIn = 1e18

Then, `shares = 1e18 * 95e18 / 100e18 = 9.5e17`.

Now, `updateDebtReporting()` is executed and `totalAssets` is increased to 102e18. If the user would have deposited after that, they would have received: `1e18 * 95e18 / 102e18 = 9.3e17` shares instead.

The higher the variance of `totalAssets` the bigger the impact on share calculation.

## Impact
This will lead to users receiving more/less shares when depositing and vice versa for withdrawals. It also opens up an arbitrage opportunity where an attacker can sandwich the `updateDebtReporting()` tx:

Given that:
- totalSupply = 95e18
- totalAssets = 100e18
- `updateDebtReporting()` increases `totalAssets` to 105e18

The attacker frontruns `updateDebtReporting()` and deposits 10e18 assets: `10e18 * 95e18 / 100e18 = 9.5e18` shares.
Now, `updateDebtReporting()` is executed. The attacker backruns that and redeems their shares: `9.5e18 * 115e18 / 104.5e18 = 10.45e18` assets. That's a profit of 0.45e18 assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The best solution would be to redesign the system so that `totalAssets` is always up-to-date. Second best is to call `updateDebtReporting` frequently so that the variance in `totalAssets` is minuscule.
