# It is possible to lock in loss for other users by not calling updateDebtReporting before withdraw
## Summary
Tokemak has mechanism in LMPDebt._calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn that limits shares and debt from the vault when there's a loss. This is to prevent withdrawer from locking in loss for other users

## Vulnerability Detail
The goal of this [code section](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L275-L280) according to the sponsor
> Goal is to not lock in a loss for other users. If the current lp is sitting at a relative loss for the lmpvault, then allowing the user to burn it all would mean other users who are staying in the vault can't benefit from a recovery. By only allowing the user to burn their porportional share we prevent that

```solidity
if (currentDvDebtValue < updatedDebtBasis) {
    // We are currently sitting at a loss. Limit the value we can pull from
    // the destination vault
    currentDvDebtValue = currentDvDebtValue.mulDiv(userShares, totalVaultShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
    currentDvShares = currentDvShares.mulDiv(userShares, totalVaultShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
}
```

The goal would be achieved if there's only one destination vault. Unfortunately, LMPVault are working with multiple destination vault and the goal could be defeated.

### POC
* Assuming there are 1 curve destination and 1 balancer destination. Each of the destination has 100 assets and therefore 200 assets in total.
* There's a loss on Curve that reduced the assets by 50%. This could be because of slashing or hack.
* totalAssets() would still be 200, compared to the real value of 150
* A user who owns 50% of the vault shares noticed this and calls withdraw/redeem
* They'll get 100 assets instead of 75 cause `totalAssets` is outdated
* The first vault which is curve would provide 25 assets cause of the mechanism
* Then request for 75 from balancer destination and it would be successful cause balancer is not at a loss
* The user gets the full 100 assets for 50% of the vault shares
* And left 50 asset for other users who have 50% of the vault shares


### Root cause
The root cause is that previewRedeem, previewWithdraw are returning a wrong value that's based on wrong totalDebt. totalDebt could have been updated with updateDebtReporting. When there's loss, users would not be inclined to update the totalDebt cause that means they'll get less asset for their shares.


## Impact
It's possible to lock in loss for other users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Quite a tough one to provide a perfect recommendation mainly because of preview functions.

We can't call _updateDebtReporting inside the preview functions because they are view functions.

We shouldn't call `_updateDebtReporting` inside withdraw and redeem. The value returned from preview that's called before submitting transaction would be different from the one returned inside the transaction. This breaks ERC4626 specifications and transactions from routers or other smart contracts would have issues.

Another solution is using bots that would submit `updateDebtReporting` transactions based on triggers. Trigger could be losses, time intervals, spikes in withdrawals, DeFi anomalies etc. This could reduce the likelihood of the issue.
