# Absence of updating of debt reporting before the withdrawal/redemption can lead to destination shares/rewards getting stuck
## Summary

Absence of proper updating of debt reporting before performing withdrawal or redemption actions  can lead to destination shares/rewards getting stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LMPVault.redeem()`/`LMPVault.withdraw()` doesn't ensure that debt reporting is updated before performing withdrawal or redemption actions. As a result, there are scenarios in which this vulnerability can lead to destination shares/rewards getting stuck:

1. **Stuck Destination Shares:** If a user does not call `updateDebtReporting` before executing a withdrawal or redemption and the underlying price of one of the destination vaults increases, it can cause destination shares to become stuck.

2. **Stuck Rewards:** When the vault receives rewards from destination vaults as part of the withdrawal process, these rewards can become stuck inside the LMPVault in the form of idle assets.

Example:

```solidity
    function test_destination_shares_get_stuck() public {
        _accessController.grantRole(Roles.SOLVER_ROLE, address(this));
        _accessController.grantRole(Roles.LMP_FEE_SETTER_ROLE, address(this));

        // User is going to deposit 1000 asset
        _asset.mint(address(this), 1000);
        _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);
        _lmpVault.deposit(1000, address(this));

        // Deployed 500 asset to DV1
        _underlyerOne.mint(address(this), 500);
        _underlyerOne.approve(address(_lmpVault), 500);
        _lmpVault.rebalance(
            address(_destVaultOne),
            address(_underlyerOne), // tokenIn
            500,
            address(0), // destinationOut, none when sending out baseAsset
            address(_asset), // baseAsset, tokenOut
            500
        );

        // Deploy 500 asset to DV2
        _underlyerTwo.mint(address(this), 500);
        _underlyerTwo.approve(address(_lmpVault), 500);
        _lmpVault.rebalance(
            address(_destVaultTwo),
            address(_underlyerTwo), // tokenIn
            500,
            address(0), // destinationOut, none when sending out baseAsset
            address(_asset), // baseAsset, tokenOut
            500
        );

        // Increase the price of DV1 to 3 times of original, so that 500 we transferred out is now worth 1500
        _mockRootPrice(address(_underlyerOne), 3e18);

        // Redeem all shares from the LMPVault
        uint256 assets = _lmpVault.redeem(
            _lmpVault.balanceOf(address(this)),
            address(this),
            address(this)
        );

        // LMPVault has 0 share, but it still holds shares from DV1 and DV2 which are stuck now
        assertEq(_lmpVault.totalSupply(), 0);

        /** the user redeemed all shares which are worth 1000 assets, 
        which is 2/3 the amount worth of assets the LMPVault holds for DV1, 
        so the user gets 500 * 2/3 = 334 shares back, and the remaining 166 shares are stuck now */
        assertEq(_destVaultOne.balanceOf(address(_lmpVault)), 166);
        // the user gets back enough assets from DV1, so DV2 is untouched and 500 of its shares are also stuck
        assertEq(_destVaultTwo.balanceOf(address(_lmpVault)), 500);
    }
```

## Impact

This vulnerability can lead to loss of funds (stuck shares and rewards).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to update the debt reporting by calling the `updateDebtReporting` function before executing withdrawal or redemption actions.
