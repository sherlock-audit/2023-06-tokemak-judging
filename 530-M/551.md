# `AbstractRewarder.rewardPerToken()` integer truncation. Possible permanent loss of rewards under slippage attack.

## Summary

This is separate issue from slippage attack to increase `rewardPerToken()` to infinity. The issue here is expecting `1e18` for division.

The `AbstractRewarder.rewardPerToken()` function can be manipulated due to its reliance on integer division without fixed-point accuracy. This design flaw may result in users not getting their full rewards. The problem is amplified when the vault's base token has a similar or low value compared to the rewardToken, e.g., CVX or USDC.

For context, under normal circumstance, if 1,000,000 USDC is deposited into the vault with a `rewardRate` of 800 (from testing data), it would require around 5.5 hours (1250 blocks) for `rewardPerToken()` to function correctly. Otherwise, it may round down the rewards to zero.

Another concern is the division by `totalSupply()` from the ERC4626 standard, which has known [vulnerabilities to slippage attacks](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc4626#the_attack). If any `destinationVault` controlling `totalAsset()` value fails, causing a drastic price drop, users can create new vault tokens at a much cheaper price, leading to higher `totalSupply()` and worsening truncation issue further.

## Vulnerability Detail

```js
    function rewardPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 total = totalSupply();
        if (total == 0) {
            return rewardPerTokenStored;
        }
        // rewardRate = 800.
        return rewardPerTokenStored + ((lastBlockRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateBlock) * rewardRate * 1e18 / total);//@audit M slippage attack total can be inflated to never increase rewardPerTokenStored again
    }
```

Here, `totalSupply()` denotes the total tokens users have in the LMPVault. However, the value of ERC4626 Vault Tokens isn't always a 1:1 representation. There can be scenarios where the value gets inflated.

In the current setup, even without significant inflation, if users deposit a large amount of base token to the vault, the reward value can round down to zero due to the division process.

## Impact

Users may face minor loss of rewards if they don't keep their tokens deposited long enough. Moreover, the possibility exists to massively increase the vault token supply. This could result in the `rewardPerToken()` always rounding down to zero, rendering the `MainRewarder.sol` contract from factory init ineffective.

## Recommendation

Convert `rewardPerToken()` return value to 1e18 fixed point value. This will prevent both truncation and inflation issue.
