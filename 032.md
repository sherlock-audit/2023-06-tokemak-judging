# Gas grief possible on unsafe external calls

## Summary
the use of low-level `call` methods can expose contracts to gas griefing attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Solidity, the use of low-level `call` methods can expose contracts to gas griefing attacks. The potential problem arises when the callee contract returns a large amount of data. This data is allocated in the memory of the calling contract, which pays for the gas costs. If the callee contract intentionally returns an enormous amount of data, the gas costs can skyrocket, causing the transaction to fail due to an Out of Gas error.

## Impact

Users may pay more gas

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

limit the use of `call` when interacting with untrusted contracts, or ensure that the callee's returned data size is capped or known in advance to prevent unexpected high gas costs.
