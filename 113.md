# Token left in LiquidationRow.sol due to Division Rounding in the _performLiquidation Function
## Summary

The division operation in the `_performLiquidation` function of the LiquidationRow contract may cause leftover tokens on the contract due to the rounding down nature of Solidity's integer division, leading to minor discrepancies in total balances and token left in the contract without any way to retrieve them

## Vulnerability Detail
In the _performLiquidation function, the contract calculates the amount to be transferred as follows:
```solidity
uint256 amount = amountReceived * vaultsBalances[i] / totalBalanceToLiquidate;
```
In Solidity, integer division always rounds down to the nearest whole number. So, if `amountReceived * vaultsBalances[i]` is not perfectly divisible by `totalBalanceToLiquidate`, the operation will round down, leaving a small remainder.

The code snippet of concern is:
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
    IDestinationVault vaultAddress = vaultsToLiquidate[i];
    // Other logic ...
    uint256 amount = amountReceived * vaultsBalances[i] / totalBalanceToLiquidate; //E @audit rounding error => tokens left
    IERC20(params.buyTokenAddress).safeTransfer(address(mainRewarder), amount);
    // Other logic ...
}
```

### Simple Example : 
```solidity
- totalBalanceToLiquidate = 50
- vaultsBalances[] = [10,13,12,3,7,5]
- amountReceived = 48 (slippage of 4% for example)

1. 48*10/50=9,6 => 9
2. 48*13/50=12,48 => 12
3. 48*12/50=11,52 => 11
4. 48*3/50=2,88 => 2
5. 48*7/50=6,72 => 6
6. 48*5/50=4,8 => 4
```
=> `Total amount sent = 9+12+11+2+6+4 = 44`
=> `Tokens left on the contract 48-44 = 4`

As long as `amountReceived != totalBalanceToLiquidate` there will be tokens left in the contract and with swap() function there will always be a small amount of slippage

## Impact

Bad accounting in the total balances between actual tokens held by the contract and the balance recorded in the `totalTokenBalances` mapping and tokens left to the contract without any way to retrieve them. The problem here is that there is no way to recover these tokens as there is in another contract with the` recover()` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a `recover()` function as you did in other contract or adjust the calculation to account for potential rounding errors. 
Maybe you could include a mechanism to handle leftover tokens, such as accumulating and adding them to future transactions using `token.balanceOf(address(this))` or `_increaseBalance()` when there is a remaining of tokens.
