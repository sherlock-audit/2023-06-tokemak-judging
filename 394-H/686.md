# Anyone can claim rewards from the rewarders to the destination vaults, DoSing `LiquidationRow` and possibly leading to stuck tokens
## Summary
Rewards from pools are supposed to be claimed only by the [`LIQUIDATOR_ROLE`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L165) via `collectRewards()` of the destination vaults, but anyone can do it directly from the rewarder of the pool and send the rewards to the vault instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
Deposits in the destination vaults deposit and stake to `Convex`, `Balancer` or `Maverick` pools, yielding rewards from their respective rewarders. 

These rewards are periodically claimed by the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE`, which should be `LiquidationRow`, using [`claimsVaultRewards()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L104), which updates the balances of the destination vaults by the rewards received. Then, [`liquidateVaultsForToken()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L167), gets the [stored balances](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L175) of the destination vaults, [swaps](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L251) for the base asset, optionally sends a fee to a [`feeReceiver`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L261) and then [queues the rewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L277) pro-rata in the rewarders.

This flow can be bypassed by calling `getReward()` of the corresponding `Convex`, `Balancer` or `Maverick` pools directly, which is permissionless, sending the tokens to the destination vaults instead. Take for example the [convex rewarder](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0a760466e1b4621579a82a39cb56dda2f4e70f03#code) of `STETH_ETH_CURVE_POOL`, function `getReward()` is permissionless (Line 980).

Created the following POC in `CurveConvexDestinationVault.t.sol`, verifying that anyone can claim the rewards of the destination vault and these are sent to it, instead of the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE`.
```solidity
function test_POC_CollectRewards_ViaBaseRewarderDirectly() public {
    // Get some tokens to play with
    vm.prank(LP_TOKEN_WHALE);
    _underlyer.transfer(address(this), 200e18);

    // Give us deposit rights
    _mockIsVault(address(this), true);

    // Deposit
    _underlyer.approve(address(_destVault), 100e18);
    _destVault.depositUnderlying(100e18);

    // Move 7 days later
    vm.roll(block.number + 7200 * 7);
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);

    _accessController.grantRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE, address(this));

    IERC20 ldo = IERC20(LDO_MAINNET);
    IERC20 crv = IERC20(CRV_MAINNET);
    IERC20 cvx = IERC20(CVX_MAINNET);

    uint256 preBalLDO = ldo.balanceOf(address(_destVault));
    uint256 preBalCRV = crv.balanceOf(address(_destVault));
    uint256 preBalCVX = cvx.balanceOf(address(_destVault));


    // Gets the rewards from the base rewarder directly
    (bool success, ) = address(0x0A760466E1B4621579a82a39CB56Dda2F4E70f03).call(
        abi.encodeWithSignature("getReward(address,bool)", address(_destVault), true));
    assertTrue(success);

    uint256 afterBalLDO = ldo.balanceOf(address(_destVault));
    uint256 afterBalCRV = crv.balanceOf(address(_destVault));
    uint256 afterBalCVX = cvx.balanceOf(address(_destVault));

    assertGt(afterBalLDO, preBalLDO);
    assertGt(afterBalCRV, preBalCRV);
    assertGt(afterBalCVX, preBalCVX);
}
```

## Impact
The rewards are sent to the destination vault instead of the `LiquidationRole`, not going through the correct flow above, leading to no rewards and possibly fees to the `feeReceiver()`. It might be possible to recover the tokens via [`recover()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L293) in the destination vault, **unless the tokens are [`trackedTokens`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L308)**, in which case they are permanently lost. Currently none of the rewards are tracked tokens, but the external integrators `Convex`, `Balancer` or `Maverick` might add a tracked token to the rewarders via [`addExtraReward()`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0a760466e1b4621579a82a39cb56dda2f4e70f03#code) (Line 826).

## Recommendation
Considering that:
- It's not possible to prevent anyone from claiming the rewards from the rewarders of the external pools directly
- The rewarders might add a tracked token to the extra rewards

`collectRewards()` in the destination vault should account for rewards already present. If these are tracked tokens, the only concern is `underlying`, as it could have pending balance from deposits. In this case, the accrued rewards should be `balanceOfUnderlying() - shares`.
