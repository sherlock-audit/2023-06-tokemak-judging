# Malicious user can claim the reward for contract to make the user lose convex reward
## Summary

Malicious user can claim the reward for contract to make the user lose convex reward

## Vulnerability Detail
in ConvexRewardsAdapter the `_claimRewards` function works in the following way.
1. first the function records the balance of an account and stores it 
2. the function then calls the getReward function 
3. now the balance after is recorded.
4. finally the contract subracts the balanceAfter- balanceBefore

we can observe this in the logic
```solidity
        // get balances before
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalLength; ++i) {
            // Using the totalSupply check to represent stash tokens. They sometimes
            // stand in as the rewardToken but they don't have a "balanceOf()"
            if (IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).totalSupply() > 0) {
                balancesBefore[i] = IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).balanceOf(account);
            }
        }

        // claim rewards
        bool result = rewardPool.getReward(account, true);
        if (!result) {
            revert RewardAdapter.ClaimRewardsFailed();
        }

        // get balances after and calculate amounts claimed
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalLength; ++i) {
            uint256 balance = 0;
            // Same check for "stash tokens"
            if (IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).totalSupply() > 0) {
                balance = IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).balanceOf(account);
            }

            amountsClaimed[i] = balance - balancesBefore[i];

            if (sendTo != address(this) && amountsClaimed[i] > 0) {
                IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(sendTo, amountsClaimed[i]);
            }
        }

        RewardAdapter.emitRewardsClaimed(rewardTokens, amountsClaimed);

        return (amountsClaimed, rewardTokens);
    }
```

This is a big problem because the function `getReward`, is public and callable by anyone. A malicious user can take adavantage of this in the following way.
1. malicious user sees `_claimReward` function in the mempool
2. malicious user frontruns this tx with `getReward` to clailm the reward for the contract in this [line of code](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCF50b810E57Ac33B91dCF525C6ddd9881B139332#code#L968)

```solidity
    function getReward(address _account, bool _claimExtras, bool _stake) public updateReward(_account){
```

4. rewards are sent to the contract
5. contract then now finally executes `_claimReward` but it is too late
6. in the `_claimReward` balance before is stored includes the reward claimed by other user
7. `_getReward` is now called but no rewards are present, so none are sent
8. balanceAfter is now recorded and because there was no change the contract will state that there are 0 rewards for the user.
9. users rewards are now stuck in the contract

## Impact
A users funds are lost and because the cost of this attack is very low compared to how much is lost, this is of high severity

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This mechanism of token accounting is flawed, i recommend to add logic that is not vulnerable to front running.
