# ConvexRewardsAdapter#claimRewards rewards can be locked into the contract forever
## Summary

ConvexRewardsAdapter#claimRewards function can be called by any user, and it can be called by malicious user to lock protocol ubclaimed reward forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

ConvexRewardsAdapter#_claimRewards function use convex `rewardPool.getReward(address _account, bool _claimExtras)` to get unclaimed rewards for users, but this function can be called by any user, see `getReward` [detail](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/a5da3f127a321467a97a684c57970d2586520172/contracts/contracts/BaseRewardPool.sol#L263). Malicious user can front-run by calling `rewardPool.getReward(address _account, bool _claimExtras)` function to get unclaimed rewards from Convex protocol to contract previously. After that, the available rewards will be 0 because protocol calculate the rewards by `rewardPool.getReward(address _account, bool _claimExtras)` function.

```solidity
// claim rewards
bool result = rewardPool.getReward(account, true);
if (!result) {
    revert RewardAdapter.ClaimRewardsFailed();
}

// get balances after and calculate amounts claimed
for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalLength; ++i) {
    uint256 balance = 0;
    // Same check for "stash tokens"
    if (IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).totalSupply() > 0) {
        balance = IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).balanceOf(account);
    }

    amountsClaimed[i] = balance - balancesBefore[i];

    if (sendTo != address(this) && amountsClaimed[i] > 0) {
        IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(sendTo, amountsClaimed[i]);
    }
}
```

After that, the unclaimed reward will be locked into the contract forever.

## Impact

Malicious user can lock protocol ubclaimed reward forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `getReward()` instead of `getReward(address _account, bool _claimExtras)`
