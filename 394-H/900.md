# Calling BaseRewardPool directly causes rewards to be locked
## Summary

A malicious actor can directly call IBaseRewardPool.getReward for `CurveConvexDestinationVault` address, which will transfer rewards into the vault without a way to get them out. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `ConvexRewards._claimRewards` claims all rewards and checks the balance difference before and after the claim to determine how much needs to be send to `sendTo`

```js
bool result = rewardPool.getReward(account, true);
...
// get balances after and calculate amounts claimed
for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalLength; ++i) {
    ...
    amountsClaimed[i] = balance - balancesBefore[i];
    if (sendTo != address(this) && amountsClaimed[i] > 0) {
        IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(sendTo, amountsClaimed[i]);
    }
}
```

The issue is that `BaseRewardPool.getReward` is openly accessible and the Vault does not account for that:

```js
    function getReward(address _account, bool _claimExtras) public updateReward(_account) returns(bool){
        uint256 reward = earned(_account);
        if (reward > 0) {
            rewards[_account] = 0;
            rewardToken.safeTransfer(_account, reward);
            IDeposit(operator).rewardClaimed(pid, _account, reward);
            emit RewardPaid(_account, reward);
        }

        //also get rewards from linked rewards
        if(_claimExtras){
            for(uint i=0; i < extraRewards.length; i++){
                IRewards(extraRewards[i]).getReward(_account);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```

So anyone can claim rewards for the vault, but the vault only sends them to `sendTo` if the vault has claimed them itself.

## Impact

Rewards lost due to being locked in the `CurveConvexDestinationVault`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the full token balance instead of calculating the difference. Unless there is a reason this cant be done, in which case another method for accounting the rewards needs to be adopted.
