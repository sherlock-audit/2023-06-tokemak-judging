# A malicious user can prevent the liquidator role receiving rewards
## Summary

A malicious user can prevent the liquidator role receiving aura rewards

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ConvexRewardsAdapter::_claimRewards` function is meant to transfer the claimed rewards to the `sendTo` address.

```solidity
             amountsClaimed[i] = balance - balancesBefore[i];
            if (sendTo != address(this) && amountsClaimed[i] > 0) {
                IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(sendTo, amountsClaimed[i]);
            }
```
This function is called from `BalancerAuraDestinationVault::_collectRewards`:

```solidity
    function _collectRewards() internal virtual override returns (uint256[] memory amounts, address[] memory tokens) {
        (amounts, tokens) = AuraRewards.claimRewards(auraStaking, defaultStakingRewardToken, msg.sender);
    }
```

Which is called by `DestinationVault::collectRewards`:

```solidity
    function collectRewards()
        external
        virtual
        override
        hasRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE)
        returns (uint256[] memory amounts, address[] memory tokens)
    {
        (amounts, tokens) = _collectRewards();
    }
```

Note that the only address allowed to call the function must have the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE`.
It is this address that the rewards are transfered to.

The issue is that Aura rewards can be claimed by anyone on behalf of the vault using the `getReward` function directly from the reward pool contract.

This would mean rewards would get sent to the Vault instead of the liquidator.

## Impact

Loss of rewards for the liquidator.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Tracking of rewards should be done in the vault to prevent the liquidator role missing out on them.
