# Performing the liquidation process reverts due to failing to swap the reward tokens
## Summary

The `liquidateVaultsForToken` function in the `LiquidationRow` contract fails to properly swap the reward tokens, causing the liquidation process to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

During the liquidation process, destination vault LP rewards are claimed, reward tokens are swapped to the desired token (usually the base asset WETH), and distributed to the respective rewarder contracts of the destination vaults. The actual token swap is performed via the `swap` function of the `BaseAsyncSwapper` contract.

The liquidation process fails due to **two issues**:

1. The `LiquidationRow.liquidateVaultsForToken` does not approve the `BaseAsyncSwapper` contract to spend the reward tokens, and the `BaseAsyncSwapper` contract does not pull in the reward tokens from the `LiquidationRow` contract. Thus, the `swap` function fails due to insufficient funds.
2. The `swap` function sells the given `sellTokenAddress` for the desired `buyTokenAddress` via a configured aggregator service. After the successful swap via the aggregator, the `swap` function determines the actual amount of `buyTokenAddress` received (`buyTokenAmountReceived`) and [reverts if it is less than the `buyAmount` specified in the `SwapParams` struct](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/BaseAsyncSwapper.sol#L23), we can conclude that the `BaseAsyncSwapper` is expected to be the receiver of the swapped tokens.

   The `swap` function **does not** transfer the bought `buyToken` tokens to the caller. This is expected in the case of the `LMPVaultRouter` contract as the [`swap` function is called via a `delegatecall`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouter.sol#L53-L55).

   However, the `LiquidationRow` contract calls the `swap` function with an ordinary `call` in the `_performLiquidation` function, as seen in line 251. Consequently, the `LiquidationRow` contract does not receive the bought tokens from the swapper, and the liquidation process fails when [attempting to queue new rewards in the reward contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L277) due to insufficient funds.

## Impact

The second step of the liquidation process within the `LiquidationRow` contract, specifically, the `liquidateVaultsForToken` function, is broken and reverts anytime a liquidation is performed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider also using a `delegatecall` in the `LiquidationRow._performLiquidation` function to call the `BaseAsyncSwapper.swap` function, similar to the `LMPVaultRouter` contract.
