# Swap during liquidation of reward tokens will revert
## Summary

Swap during liquidation of reward tokens will revert. As a result, reward tokens collected from external protocols cannot be liquidated and transferred to the LMPVault/Destination Vaults, leading to a loss to the vault shareholders.

## Vulnerability Detail

The root cause of this issue is that the swap performed during the liquidation should be called via "delegated call" instead of "function call".

**Problem 1**

The reward tokens are stored on the `LiquidationRow` contract before liquidation. When performing the liquidation via the [`LiquidationRow.liquidateVaultsForToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L167) function, the `AsyncSwapper.swap` function will be called at Line 251 below. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L240

```solidity
File: LiquidationRow.sol
240:     function _performLiquidation(
241:         uint256 gasBefore,
242:         address fromToken,
243:         address asyncSwapper,
244:         IDestinationVault[] memory vaultsToLiquidate,
245:         SwapParams memory params,
246:         uint256 totalBalanceToLiquidate,
247:         uint256[] memory vaultsBalances
248:     ) private {
249:         uint256 length = vaultsToLiquidate.length;
250:         // the swapper checks that the amount received is greater or equal than the params.buyAmount
251:         uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);
```

Within the `AsyncSwapper.swap` function, the `AsyncSwapper` contract will check that it has received the reward tokens that need to be swapped at Line 30 below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/BaseAsyncSwapper.sol#L19

```solidity
File: BaseAsyncSwapper.sol
19:     function swap(SwapParams memory swapParams) public virtual nonReentrant returns (uint256 buyTokenAmountReceived) {
..SNIP..
25:         IERC20 sellToken = IERC20(swapParams.sellTokenAddress);
26:         IERC20 buyToken = IERC20(swapParams.buyTokenAddress);
27: 
28:         uint256 sellTokenBalance = sellToken.balanceOf(address(this));
29: 
30:         if (sellTokenBalance < swapParams.sellAmount) {
31:             revert InsufficientBalance(sellTokenBalance, swapParams.sellAmount);
32:         }
```

However, it was observed that the `LiquidationRow.liquidateVaultsForToken` function did not transfer the reward tokens from the `LiquidationRow` contract to the `AsyncSwapper` contract. As a result, the swap will always fail and revert.

**Problem 2**

Even if the `AsyncSwapper.swap` function managed to swap the reward tokens to new tokens, the received tokens are not sent back to the `LiquidationRow` contract.

## Impact

Reward tokens collected from external protocols cannot be liquidated and transferred to the DV/LMPVault, leading to a loss to the vault shareholders.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The correct approach is to use a `delegatedCall` similar to that used within the [`LMPVaultRouter.swapAndDepositToVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouter.sol#L53) function. In this case, it will work properly and swap the reward tokens on the `LiquidationRow` contract.

    uint256 gasBefore,

    uint256 totalBalanceToLiquidate,
    uint256[] memory vaultsBalances
) private {
    uint256 length = vaultsToLiquidate.length;
    // the swapper checks that the amount received is greater or equal than the params.buyAmount
-    uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);
+    bytes memory data = swapper.functionDelegateCall(
+    	abi.encodeWithSignature("swap((address,uint256,address,uint256,bytes,bytes))", params), "SwapFailed"
