# Rewards are never earned because `AsyncSwapper` never receives tokens during liquidation
## Summary
During the liquidation process, Tokemak claims rewards from each vault and sends them to the swapper contract to convert the reward tokens into target asset, e.g. WETH. This process will always revert because the `LiquidatorRow` contract never sends the claimed tokens to the `AsyncSwapper` while the `AsyncSwapper` expects the tokens to have already been sent. Therefore, the entire protocol will not earn any rewards for the stake holders. Effectively, the main purpose of the protocol, yield generation, is broken.

## Vulnerability Detail
Reward tokens are claimed for each vault via `LiquidatorRow.claimsVaultRewards()`:

Next, the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` must call `LiquidatorRow.liquidateVaultsForToken()` to convert the reward tokens into target asset:

This function calls two internal functions, `_prepareForLiquidation()` and `_performLiquidation()`, neither of which transfer tokens to the swapper contract.

As can be seen, the swapper function is called in the first line of the `_performLiquidation()` function. The tokens must be transferred in `_prepareForLiquidation()`, however they are not. E.g. There are no `transfer()` calls nor are there any `transferFrom()` calls within the AsyncSwapper contract. The `swap()` function will always revert with `revert InsufficientBalance(sellTokenBalance, swapParams.sellAmount);`

Looking at the test file for this process, the final swapped tokens are simply mock minted to the liquidator row contract instead of performing an actual transfer/swap.

## Impact
- Yield is never earned by users.
- The Tokemak protocol does not provide any benefit to stakeholders.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Upon discussing with sponsor, they replied that the original intention was probably to call AsyncSwapper.swap() via `delegatecall` instead of a normal call.
