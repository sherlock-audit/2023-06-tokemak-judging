# `LiquidationRow.liquidateVaultsForToken` is not working correctly.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
`BaseAsyncSwapper` is a contract with a `swap` function that is used through delegate calls.
Like this below
```solidity
function swapAndDepositToVault(
        address swapper,
        SwapParams memory swapParams,
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 minSharesOut
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
        systemRegistry.asyncSwapperRegistry().verifyIsRegistered(swapper);
        pullToken(IERC20(swapParams.sellTokenAddress), swapParams.sellAmount, address(this));

        // verify that the swap is for the vault asset
        if (swapParams.buyTokenAddress != vault.asset()) revert Errors.InvalidParams();
        bytes memory data = swapper.functionDelegateCall( <= delegateCall
            abi.encodeWithSignature("swap((address,uint256,address,uint256,bytes,bytes))", swapParams), "SwapFailed"
        );

        uint256 amountReceived = abi.decode(data, (uint256));

        return _deposit(vault, to, amountReceived, minSharesOut);
    }
```
However, in `LiquidationRow.sol,` the swapper is used as an external call.
```solidity
function _performLiquidation(
        uint256 gasBefore,
        address fromToken,
        address asyncSwapper,
        IDestinationVault[] memory vaultsToLiquidate,
        SwapParams memory params,
        uint256 totalBalanceToLiquidate,
        uint256[] memory vaultsBalances
    ) private {
        uint256 length = vaultsToLiquidate.length;
        // the swapper checks that the amount received is greater or equal than the params.buyAmount
        uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params); <= external call
```

In order to use the `swapper` externally, we need to send a token to the `swapper`. But that logic doesn't exist, so we have to use it as a `delegateCall`.

However there is problem with using `delegateCall` is that `liquidateVaultsForToken`, where the swap is called in `LiquidationRow.sol`, has a `nonReentrant` modifier, which conflicts with `nonReentrant` in `BaseAsyncSwapper.swap`. If `swap` is called while already `_ENTERED`, a revert will occur.

Therefore, `performLiquidation` cannot be used properly.

## Impact
`performLiquidation` does not perform properly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `performLiquidation`, change swap as a `delegatecall`, and remove the `nonReentrant` from `BaseAsyncSwapper.swap`.
