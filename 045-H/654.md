# Absence of Approval causes DOS/Revertion at all times
## Summary
`_performLiquidation` function of `LiquidationRow.sol` is where the actual liquidation process happens and it involves a swapping of tokens using `BaseAsyncSwapper.sol` where "sell tokens" are swapped for "buy tokens". These "buy tokens" received by `LiquidationRow.sol` is further used to pay fees and for other purposes. But after the swapping , `BaseAsyncSwapper.sol` contract doesn't send back the "buy tokens" back to  `LiquidationRow.sol` which it should, causing reverts at all times.  
## Vulnerability Detail
In `_performLiquidation` function of `LiquidationRow.sol` at :
```solidity
        // the swapper checks that the amount received is greater or equal than the params.buyAmount
        uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);
```
swapping happens where "sell tokens" are swapped for "buy tokens". Now looking into `BaseAsyncSwapper.sol` contract (which is used for swapping) , we see :

after swapping , the buy tokens are neither send back to nor any approval is given to `LiquidationRow.sol` .
In the next step after swapping in `_performLiquidation` function of `LiquidationRow.sol` , we can see that the function performs a transfer of "buy tokens"[transferring fees(which is in buy token) to feeReceiver ] , which will fail at almost all times causing DOS.
```solidity
        if (feeReceiver != address(0) && feeBps > 0) {
            uint256 fee = calculateFee(amountReceived);
            emit FeesTransfered(feeReceiver, amountReceived, fee);

            // adjust the amount received after deducting the fee
            amountReceived -= fee;
            // transfer fee to the fee receiver
            IERC20(params.buyTokenAddress).safeTransfer(feeReceiver, fee);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either do an approval and have the "buy tokens" pulled to `LiquidationRow.sol` or do a delegatecall to swap contract.
