# rewards claimed through LiquidatorRow.sol will get stuck and lost
## Summary
rewards claimed through LiquidatorRow.sol will get stuck and lost

## Vulnerability Detail
liquidations of vaults rewards is done through  `LiquidatorRow.sol` and it happens in 2 distinct txs:

- `claimsVaultRewards` that harvests ALL the rewards from the destination vaults passed as parameter. this tx doesn't reverts and the rewards are successfully transfered to the  `LiquidatorRow.sol` contract
- `liquidateVaultsForToken` that swaps the rewards (that are already in the contract) of `fromToken` in `buyTokenAddress` and sends it to the respective rewarder contract

the latter has a mistake in this line:
```solidity        
 uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);
```

as the swap fn of swappers is intended to  be used with a `delegatecall` since it doesn't pull the tokens from sender, and sender doesn't transfer tokens to the asyncSwapper.
This results in the swap always reverting for insufficient funds, so the `liquidateVaultsForToken` call ALWAYS fails and the previously claimed rewards are stuck in this contract with no way to recover them, effectively losing those funds.


## Impact
if not fixed, ALL the vaults would lose all the generated rewards everytime a liquidator tries to liquidate them. If not catched for a long span of time it can lead to a significant loss of funds + making the vaults effectively rewardsless

note that this fix  is not catched by provided automatic tests even though there are test for the liquidator because there the swap is replaced with a simple burn and mint to simplify as it is assumed that it never reverts. So probably this bug would have not been noticed until deploy.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
as done in the `LMPVaultRouter.sol`, call the swap function like this:
```solidity
bytes memory data = swapper.functionDelegateCall(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("swap((address,uint256,address,uint256,bytes,bytes))", swapParams), "SwapFailed"
        );

        uint256 amountReceived = abi.decode(data, (uint256));
```
