# Absence of `params.sellToken` transfer from `LiquidationRow` to `asyncSwapper` during liquidation process
## Summary
Please refer to the Detailed Description section for insights.

## Vulnerability Detail
The task of executing the liquidation process is assigned to the function `LiquidationRow._performLiquidation()`.
```solidity=
function _performLiquidation(
    uint256 gasBefore,
    address fromToken,
    address asyncSwapper,
    IDestinationVault[] memory vaultsToLiquidate,
    SwapParams memory params,
    uint256 totalBalanceToLiquidate,
    uint256[] memory vaultsBalances
) private {
    uint256 length = vaultsToLiquidate.length;
    // The swapper ensures the received amount is greater or equal to params.buyAmount
    uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);

    ...
```

The initial step of the liquidation process involves invoking the swapper contract to conduct a token swap against the target token, as outlined in the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak-Trumpero/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/README.md#liquidate-rewards). This is achieved through an external call to `asyncSwapper.swap()`.
```solidity=
function swap(SwapParams memory swapParams) public virtual nonReentrant returns (uint256 buyTokenAmountReceived) {
    ...

    uint256 sellTokenBalance = sellToken.balanceOf(address(this));

    if (sellTokenBalance < swapParams.sellAmount) {
        revert InsufficientBalance(sellTokenBalance, swapParams.sellAmount);
    }

    LibAdapter._approve(sellToken, AGGREGATOR, swapParams.sellAmount);

    ...
}
```

Upon inspecting the `BaseAsyncSwapper.swap()` function, it is evident that the sender is required to provide `swapParams.sellToken` to the `BaseAsyncSwapper` contract before invoking the function. However, the crucial step of transferring `params.sellAmount` of `params.sellToken` from the `LiquidationRow` to the `asyncSwapper` is absent in the `LiquidationRow.liquidateVaultsForToken()` function.

==> This omission leads to the accumulation of rewards within the `LiquidationRow` contract, effectively causing them to become frozen.

## Impact
Accumulated rewards may become trapped within the `LiquidationRow` contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before invoking `asyncSwapper.swap()`, ensure the transfer of `params.sellAmount` of `params.sellToken` to the `asyncSwapper`.
