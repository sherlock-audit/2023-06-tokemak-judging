# It is not possible to liquidate rewards
## Summary

The liquidation of rewards process will revert, as `IAsyncSwapper::swap()` is not executed in the context of the Liquidator Row contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LiquidationRow.sol::liquidateVaultsForToken()` calls `IAsyncSwapper::swap()` to swap `fromToken` for `params.buyTokenAddress` and transfer the received amount to the fee receiver (if the fee feature is turned on) and to the vaults.

The implementation of `IAsyncSwapper`, in the `BaseAsyncSwapper.sol` contract, does not pull the tokens to be sold nor does it transfer the received tokens to the caller. So in order for the swap to succeed, the call to `IAsyncSwapper::swap()` must be executed in the context of the `LiquidatorRow` contract. This is reflected in the [diagram of the liquidation process](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1s_vQgDn0cFG4PZSY_pkKUzk31h23Vs6k) by the `delegatecall swap(data)` call.

However, in the implementation of `LiquidationRow.sol::liquidateVaultsForToken()`, the call to `IAsyncSwapper::swap()` is not executed using `delegatecall`, so the swap will be executed in the context of the `BaseAsyncSwapper.sol` contract, which means that the transaction will revert, either because `BaseAsyncSwapper.sol` does not have enough tokens to sell or because `LiquidationRow.sol` does not have enough tokens to transfer to the fee receiver and the vaults.

## Impact

It will not be possible to liquidate rewards for the vaults.

## Recommendation

```diff
-    uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);
+    (bool success, bytes memory data) = asyncSwapper.delegatecall(
+        abi.encodeWithSelector(IAsyncSwapper.swap.selector, params)
+    );
+
+    if (!success) {
+        revert SwapFailed();
+    }
+    
+    uint256 amountReceived = abi.decode(data, (uint256));
