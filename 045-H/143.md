# Perform liquidations function always fails.
## Summary

The **liquidateVaultsForToken function** will always fail due to missing **delegateCall function** when calling asyncSwapper for swapping.

## Vulnerability Detail
Upon conducting a thorough review of the function `_performLiquidation()` located in the **LiquidationRow** contract you can notice the line below:

```Solidity
uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);
```
It is evident that swapper is called through the utilization of the swap function.  The appropriate swap should be executed with assets presented in the liquidationRow contract. Nevertheless, the absence of the delegateCall function results in the external invocation of the  `swap()` function, inevitably leading to a reverting state. The asyncWrapper contract checks if certain balances for swapping are presented in the contract. In current design it could work only when assets from LiquidationRow are sent to swapper. As a result of this bug, all claimed rewards from destination vaults will be stuck in the contract.


### POC
The following Poc test below fails.(please add it into LiquidationRow.t.sol) - This is a complete proof that the function does not work properly.

```Solidity
function test_OnlyLiquidateGivenTokenForGivenVaults() public { // This test fails
        BaseAsyncSwapper asyncSwapper = new BaseAsyncSwapper(ONE_INCH_MAINNET);
        liquidationRow.addToWhitelist(address(asyncSwapper));

        _mockComplexScenario(address(testVault));
        IDestinationVault[] memory vaults = _initArrayOfOneTestVault();
        liquidationRow.claimsVaultRewards(vaults);

        SwapParams memory swapParams = SwapParams(
            address(rewardToken2),
            200,
            address(targetToken),
            200,
            new bytes(0),
            new bytes(0)
        );
         // vm.expectRevert();
        liquidationRow.liquidateVaultsForToken(address(rewardToken2), address(asyncSwapper), vaults, swapParams);
    
```
*Note: In other tests, you can see that swapping works. It is a result of using their own MockSwapper in tests, which just mints targetToken.*

## Impact
As a result of this issue, the LMPVault will never accrue the interest from destinations given that the updateDebtReporting function will never work. Consequently, the LiquidationRow contract will never distribute rewards to the destinationâ€™s rewarders and rewards will be stuck in that contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use delegateCall function when using asyncSwapper.
