# LiquidationRow.liquidateVaultsForToken(...) will always revert due to missing token transfers
## Summary

The `LiquidationRow.liquidateVaultsForToken(...)` method, which is a core functionality of the protocol, will revert in any case due to missing token transfers to and from the async swapper making the protocol unable to liquidate rewards from the destination vaults, swap them & forward them to the main rewarder, i.e. loss of assets for protocol/users.

## Vulnerability Detail

### Contract [BaseAsyncSwapper](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/liquidation/BaseAsyncSwapper.sol) is `IAsyncSwapper`

The [swap(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/liquidation/BaseAsyncSwapper.sol#L19-L65) method requires that the `sellAmount` of `sellToken` was already transferred to the contract, see [L28-32](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/liquidation/BaseAsyncSwapper.sol#L28-L32), before the `swap(...)` method is callled in order to succeed. Otherwise it will revert with `InsufficientBalance`.  
Furthermore, the swapped `buyTokenAmountReceived` of `buyToken` is never transferred back to the `msg.sender` and therefore irrecoverably stuck.
At this point it looks like this contract intended to be used via `delegatecall`, but in fact it is **not** used that way.  

See `test_swap()` in [OneInchAdapter.t.sol](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/test/liquidators/OneInchAdapter.t.sol#L46-L73) and [ZeroExAdapter.t.sol](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/test/liquidators/ZeroExAdapter.t.sol#L45-L72) for correct usage of `swap(...)` by transferring tokens beforehand. (Swapped tokens are still stuck, but this is not covered by the test cases.)

*Side note: An excess amount of `sellToken` is not refunded by the swap method. Furthmore, if the `sellToken` were transferred in a separate transaction, they become stuck on swap failure. However, this is not the focus of this report.*

### Contract [LiquidationRow](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol)

The [liquidateVaultsForToken(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L153-L180) method, which liquidates the `fromToken` using an async swapper (see above), subsequently relies on [_performLiquidation(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L226-L281) which performs the async swap in [L251](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L251).  
However, here the [IAsyncSwapper.swap(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/liquidation/BaseAsyncSwapper.sol#L19-L65) method is just called "normally" and **not** via  `delegatecall`. In addition, the `fromToken` are not transferred to the async swapper, therefore `liquidateVaultsForToken(...)` will always revert with `IAsyncSwapper.InsufficientBalance` and **no** liquidations are possible in any case.

*Side note: This cannot be circumvented by transferring the `fromToken` to the async swapper directly before calling `liquidateVaultsForToken(...)` since the swapped `buyToken` will still be stuck in the async swapper.* 

### Use case [LiquidationRow.t.sol](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/test/liquidators/LiquidationRow.t.sol)

Just to provide further clarification for the reader: The test cases in the [LiquidateVaultsForToken](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/test/liquidators/LiquidationRow.t.sol#L498-L638) contract show that the `LiquidationRow` contract (and not the asyc swapper) is expected to hold the `fromToken`, see [L213](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/test/liquidators/LiquidationRow.t.sol#L213). This again confirms the issue that a token transfer is missing in  [LiquidationRow._performLiquidation(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L226-L281) before initiating the swap.  

*Yes, but why are the test cases passing then?*  
The test cases use an [AsyncSwapperMock](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/test/liquidators/LiquidationRow.t.sol#L37-L50) contract which overrides the `BaseAsyncSwapper.swap(...)` method and therfore does not require an inbound tansfer of  `sellToken` and replaces the missing outbound transfer of `buyToken` with a simple token mint to the `LiquidationRow` contract.

## Impact

The [LiquidationRow.liquidateVaultsForToken(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L153-L180) method, which is a core functionality of the protocol and intended to be invoked via the sponsor's automated off-chain components, will **always** revert.  

As a consequence, the mechanism to liquidate vault rewards into another asset such as WETH, see [README](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/tree/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/liquidation), is not available and therefore resulting in a loss of funds for the protocol/users due to not being able to liquidate claimed rewards from the destination vaults, swap them & forward them to the main rewarder. As a further consequence of this, destination vault rewards claimed via `LiquidationRow.claimsVaultRewards(...)` are then permanently stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet

The following PoC modifies the `LiquidationRow` test in a way that the `AsyncSwapperMock` behaves more like the real `BaseAsyncSwapper`. As a result, the [LiquidationRow.liquidateVaultsForToken(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L153-L180) method fails in any case and therefore proves the above claims.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1.  Carefully consider using  [IAsyncSwapper.swap(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/liquidation/BaseAsyncSwapper.sol#L19-L65) via `delegatecall` since it seems intended to be used this way.
2.  **Or** fix the missing tansfer of `sellToken`/`fromToken` from the `LiquidationRow` contract to the async swapper and the missing transfer of  `buyToken` from the async swapper to the `LiquidationRow` contract.  
In this case, make sure that excess `sellToken` are refunded and all `sellToken` are refunded on swap failure.
