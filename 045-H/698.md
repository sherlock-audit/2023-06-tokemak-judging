# Lost rewards claimed in `LiquidationRow` as the `swap()` function is not delegate called to in `liquidateVaultsForToken()`
## Summary
Can't send rewards to rewarders via `LiquidationRow:liquidateVaultsForToken()` because `_performLiquidation()` does not delegate call to the `asyncSwapper`, but uses a "normal" call instead. The claimed tokens will be forever stuck, as there is no way to withdraw them.

## Vulnerability Detail
`LiquidationRow` queues rewards to rewarders in 2 steps:
- `claimsVaultRewards()` goes through a list of vaults and collects the rewards to the `LiquidationRow`.
- `liquidateVaultsForToken()` fetches the previous claimed rewards, swaps them for the base asset and sends them to the rewarders pro-rata via `queueNewRewards()`.

Thus, if `liquidateVaultsForToken()` is broken, the claimed funds in `claimsVaultRewards()` are lost.

In this case, `liquidateVaultsForToken()` calls `IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);`, without ever approving the `asyncSwapper`. In fact, the `asyncSwapper` was expected to be delegate called to, not "regular" called. 

This bug was not found in the tests because the `asyncSwapper` was mocked in `LiquidationRow.t.sol`.

Tried to figure out a way to withdraw via the `feeReceiver`, by setting the fee to `100%`, but it's impossible, the path always ends up reverting.

## Impact
Lost rewards stuck in the `LiquidationRow` contract. 

## Code Snippet
- [`LiquidationRow:claimsVaultRewards()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L104)
- `LiquidationRow` in `_performLiquidation()`, called by `liquidateVaultsForToken()`, [calling the `asyncSwapper`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L251) instead of delegate calling.
- [Diagram](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1s_vQgDn0cFG4PZSY_pkKUzk31h23Vs6k) explaining that the `asyncSwapper` should be delegate called to.
- `asyncSwapper` being [mocked](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/test/liquidators/LiquidationRow.t.sol#L46) in the tests.

## Recommendation
Delegate call to the `asyncSwapper`, similarly to the `LMPVaultRouter`:
```solidity
bytes memory data = asyncSwapper.functionDelegateCall(
    abi.encodeWithSignature("swap((address,uint256,address,uint256,bytes,bytes))", swapParams), "SwapFailed"
);
```
