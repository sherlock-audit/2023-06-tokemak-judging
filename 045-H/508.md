# Tokens are not being transferred to swapper before swapping in LiquidationRow contract
## Summary
Tokens are not being transferred to `asyncSwapper` before calling asyncSwapper's `swap` function in `_performLiquidation` function of `LiquidationRow` contract

## Vulnerability Detail
1. In `LiquidationRow` contract to liquidate a particular reward token into `_baseAsset ` `asyncSwapper` is being used.
2. Actually the reward tokens need to be transferred to swapper before swapping them to  `_baseAsset` token. 
3. But tokens are not being transferred in this case.


## Impact
call to `liquidateVaultsForToken` will always revert.So a liquidator cannot liquidate Destination vault rewards

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
function _performLiquidation(
        uint256 gasBefore,
        address fromToken,
        address asyncSwapper,
        IDestinationVault[] memory vaultsToLiquidate,
        SwapParams memory params,
        uint256 totalBalanceToLiquidate,
        uint256[] memory vaultsBalances
    ) private {
        uint256 length = vaultsToLiquidate.length;
        // the swapper checks that the amount received is greater or equal than the params.buyAmount
+       IERC20(fromToken).safeTransfer(asyncSwapper,totalBalanceToLiquidate);
        uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);
 ```
