# Users will get burned more assets than they are supposed to by using stale debt/share data
## Summary
Users will get burned more assets than they are supposed to  by using stale debt/share data

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling redeem or withdraw on the `LMPVault` contract, there will be the escenario where you have to calcualte the exact amount of shares to burn from the user by calling the function `_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn()`

```solidity
 for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawalQueueLength; ++i) {
                IDestinationVault destVault = IDestinationVault(withdrawalQueue[i]);
                (uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) = _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
                    destVault,
                    shares,
                    info.totalAssetsToPull - Math.max(info.debtDecrease, info.totalAssetsPulled), //max normally means the biggest number
                    totalVaultShares
                );
```

This function directly gets the information from the destination vault directly from a mapping called `destinationInfo`

```solidity
 (sharesToBurn, totalDebtBurn) = LMPDebt._calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
            destinationInfo[address(destVault)], destVault, userShares, maxAssetsToPull, totalVaultShares
        );
```

The problem here is the data/params from this mapping are not updated at the time of calling `redeem()` or `withdraw()`. Therefore this data is stale and user will get burned a faulty amount of shares due to the stale data.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The data from the mapping `destinationInfo` should be updated before calling `redeem()` or `withdraw()`. This is done by calling `updateDebtReporting()` with the destinations of the vaults that you will withdraw from.
```solidity
    function updateDebtReporting(address[] calldata _destinations) external nonReentrant trackNavOps {
        _updateDebtReporting(_destinations);  
    }
```
