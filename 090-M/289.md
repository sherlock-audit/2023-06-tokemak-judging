# Hard-coded slippage may freeze user funds during market turbulence
## Summary
If volatile market conditions happen, users can't withdraw their funds from the vault.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function withdraw(
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 maxSharesOut,
        bool unwrapWETH
    ) public virtual override returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
        address destination = unwrapWETH ? address(this) : to;

        sharesOut = vault.withdraw(amount, destination, msg.sender);
        if (sharesOut > maxSharesOut) {
            revert MaxSharesError();
        }

        if (unwrapWETH) {
            _processWethOut(to);
        }
    }
```
When the user withdraws, the user can use maxSharesOut parameter for slippage protection. There is one more slippage protection inside the withdrawing process.
```solidity
uint256 actualAssets = _withdraw(assets, shares, receiver, owner);

        if (actualAssets < assets) {
            revert TooFewAssets(assets, actualAssets);
        }
```
If the actualAssests that returns from _withdraw() function is less than the user input assets parameter, the function will revert.
If there are not enough idle funds in the LMPVault, the rest of the funds are withdrawn from Destination Vaults.
```solidity
uint256 withdrawalQueueLength = withdrawalQueue.length;
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawalQueueLength; ++i) {
                IDestinationVault destVault = IDestinationVault(withdrawalQueue[i]);
                (uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) = _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
                    destVault,
                    shares,
                    info.totalAssetsToPull - Math.max(info.debtDecrease, info.totalAssetsPulled),
                    totalVaultShares
                );
                if (sharesToBurn == 0) {
                    continue;
                }

                uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
                uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));
```
If one destination vault is not enough, funds are withdrawn from other destination vaults as well. (withdrawalQueue.length)

The problem is, let's say there are 3 destination vaults. (withdrawalQueue.length == 3)
The volatile market condition happens, and funds coming from destination vaults are less than usual.(due to swaps)
There is a chance that [actualAssests](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L414-L418) won't equal user input [assets parameter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L401).

Because of too strict or hard-coded slippage, the user can't withdraw his funds and his funds are locked.


## Impact
Users funds may be locked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Pass a slippage parameter for the [assets](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L401) or remove the [check.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L416-L418)
