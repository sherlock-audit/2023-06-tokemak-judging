# Double scaling of price filters in IncentivePricingStats.sol
## Summary
In calculator IncentivePricingStats.sol there is a double scaling issue that leads to incorrect values in filter variables, influencing what a price value the calculator will return.

## Vulnerability Detail
The bug/vulnerability itself is in the function `updatePricingInfo()`, which updates the price for a specific token. The problem occurs in the `if block statement` when the initialization of filters should be applied. As you can see in the code below:
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/stats/calculators/IncentivePricingStats.sol#L156)
```Solidity
if (existing._initCount == INIT_SAMPLE_COUNT) {
                // if this sample hits the target number, then complete initialize and set the filters
                existing._initComplete = true;
                uint256 averagePrice = (existing._initAcc * 1e18) / INIT_SAMPLE_COUNT; //@audit-issue double scaling
                existing.fastFilterPrice = averagePrice;
                existing.slowFilterPrice = averagePrice;
            }
```
The averagePrice variable is scaled by `1e18`; however, the price itself is already `e18` (which is saved in existing_initAcc value), therefore the value which will be stored in fastFilterPrice and slowFilterPrice will be scaled to `e36` leading to incorrect calculations every time the snapshot is taken, and the value returned for current stats will be changed - leading to incorrect rebalancing in the remaining parts of the system.

### POC
Logs from tests showing that the price of filters is really scaled to e36.

## Impact
Based on the response from the protocol team:

- _"IncentivePricingStats is used by the rebalancing logic to determine if a rebalance is beneficial for the system. So this bug would likely have resulted in some (difficult to assess how many) suboptimal rebalances during that ~4 day window, leading to a bit of NAV decay due to slippage. There are also a number of safeguards in place to mitigate NAV decay during rebalancings, including a maximum overall slippage, maximum APRs (e.g., it will reduce a very high APR to a sensible limit), as well as explicit NAV decay checks."_

- _"IncentivePricing is never used to calculate a vault's NAV, so there are not direct implications on that part of the system. The absolute worst case is the suboptimal rebalances leading to unneeded slippage."_ 


=> **As a result, a bad price will lead to non beneficial rebalances for the system and unwanted slippages, which we can summarise as an indirect loss of assets.**

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove double scaling.
```diff
- uint256 averagePrice = (existing._initAcc * 1e18) / INIT_SAMPLE_COUNT
+ uint256 averagePrice = existing._initAcc / INIT_SAMPLE_COUNT
```
