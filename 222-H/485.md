# Rewards of LMPVault in DestinationVault.rewarder could be stolen with flashloan
## Summary
A flashloan sequence of `deposit -> updateDebtReporting -> withdraw` could take value from LMPVault rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
updateDebtReporting would increase idle and NAV if it claims reward even though debt doesn't change.

* Assuming there's 0 idle for simplicity and 100 assets in debt
* The asset share ratio is 1 so there are 100 shares
* Attacker notices that liquidator has queued new rewards and LMP vault has earned 10 assets (mempool or etherscan)
* They deposits 900 assets for 900 shares. Ratio is still 1 cause conversion uses outdated totalIdle.
* They call updateDebtReporting which increases idle by 10 assets
* Now, there are 910 totalIdle and 100 totalDebt
* Therefore 1000 shares for 1010 assets a ratio of 1.01
* They call withdraw and based on the 900 shares, they'll get 909 assets
* The 9 assets taken by the attacker are rewards that belong to the original owners of the LMPVault 100 circulating shares.

## Impact
Attacker could steal rewards that belong to users. The likelihood is high cause rewards are distributed instantly in `rewarder.queueNewRewards`. No reward, no incentives, no users.
