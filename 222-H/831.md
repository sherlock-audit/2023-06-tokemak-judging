# DestinationVault rewards can always be stolen by anyone
## Summary

The LMPVault receives base assets rewards from the DestinationVault's MainRewarder, which increase the value of an LMPVault share. These rewards can be stolen each time by anyone using flash-staking.

## Vulnerability Detail

The LMPVault uses the base assets in the vault to obtain shares in a DestinationVault. Each DestinationVault also has a MainRewarder, which emits rewards in the vaults base assets.

These rewards are claimed in `LMPVault:_updateDebtReporting` and added to the `idleIncrease` value on lines 771-776:
```solidity
uint256 beforeBaseAsset = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
IMainRewarder(destVault.rewarder()).getReward(address(this), false);
uint256 claimedRewardValue = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - beforeBaseAsset;
idleIncrease += claimedRewardValue;
```

The `idleIncrease` value is directly used in `LMPVault:totalAssets`, which again is used in `_convertToAssets` and `_convertToShares`:
```solidity
function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {
    return totalIdle + totalDebt;
}
function _convertToShares(uint256 assets, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
    uint256 supply = totalSupply();
    shares = (assets == 0 || supply == 0) ? assets : assets.mulDiv(supply, totalAssets(), rounding);
}
function _convertToAssets(uint256 shares, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 assets) {
    uint256 supply = totalSupply();
    assets = (supply == 0) ? shares : shares.mulDiv(totalAssets(), supply, rounding);
}
```

So this means that the increase of `idleIncrease` with the rewards will also increase the share rate and so the rewards are distributed among the stakers/holders of LMPVault shares.

The function that claims the rewards is callable from `LMPVault:updateDebtReporting`, which is permissionless and so it can be called by anyone at any time:
```solidity
function updateDebtReporting(address[] calldata _destinations) external nonReentrant trackNavOps {
    _updateDebtReporting(_destinations);
}
```

Because of this, the timing and state of the LMPVault could be controlled by an attacker, before calling the reward claiming function. Because the LMPVault does not have withdrawal queue or unstake delay, it becomes possible to do this using flash-loan staking.

The first LMPVault will use a base asset of WETH, which can be easily flash-loaned from various places.

In a single transaction, the attacker could:
- Flash-loan 100m+ amount of WETH.
- Deposit the WETH into the LMPVault and obtain >99% of all shares. 
- (The max per wallet restriction can be easily bypassed by using multiple contracts).
- Call `updateDebtReporting`, which will claim the rewards and increase the share rate.
- Withdraw all of the shares, which will return the 100m+ WETH + >99% of the DestinationVault's claimed rewards.

The above scenario can also be repeated each time.

## Impact

By making of the flash-staking, an attacker can repeatedly steal almost all of the LMPVault's rewards from each DestinationVault.

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode

## Recommendation

Preferably, reward distribution should be linear, but this might be difficult with the multiple vaults and dynamic APR. 

At the least, flash-loan staking should be made impossible by employing an unstake delay of 1 block.
