# Risk-free profits for an attacker due to outdated debt reporting during `LMPVault` deposits
## Summary

If a destination vault has ("unrealized") profits, i.e., the debt reporting is not updated yet, or no rebalance has been performed yet, an attacker can deposit into the `LMPVault` and receive more shares than eligible. The attacker can then update the debt reporting by calling the public `LMPVault.updateDebtReporting` function and immediately redeem the shares, resulting in an instant risk-free profit for the attacker.

## Vulnerability Detail

Depositing assets (WETH) into the `LMPVault` contract determines the number of shares to be minted, [calculated internally by the `_convertToShares` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L329). The `_convertToShares` function [retrieves the current asset amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L591) via `totalAssets()`.

The amount of total assets is composed of the idle funds (`totalIdle`) plus the total debt of all destination vaults (`totalDebt`):

```solidity
304: function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {
305:     return totalIdle + totalDebt;
306: }
```

However, both values do not represent the current state. For instance, the price of one of the destination vault's underlyer tokens can increase, resulting in profits. Similarly, the idle amount can increase due to accumulated destination vault rewards, which are based on LP staking rewards (liquidated by the `LiquidationRow` contract and distributed as `MainRewarder` rewards).

If anyone (e.g., an attacker) deposits at the time when those two values are not up-to-date, e.g., when destination vaults experience price increases, the depositor receives the same amount of shares as any previous depositor who had funds deposited for a longer amount of time. This results in unfairly distributed and risk-free profits for the depositor (attacker).

The following test case demonstrates how an attacker is able to make a risk-free deposit and realize profits due to the debt reporting not being updated before the deposit. Resulting in the ordinary user receiving less profit.

Specifically, _two_ scenarios are shown:

1. No attacker, the ordinary user realizes profits and receives all profits
2. Attacker deposits before having the debt reporting updated. This dilutes the ordinary user's profits, and the attacker can risk-free redeem and realize profits

## Impact

User's profits are diluted by an attacker who deposits before the debt reporting is updated, resulting in risk-free profits for the attacker.

## Code Snippet

[src/vault/LMPVault.totalAssets](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L305)

`totalDebt` represents the deployed assets of all destination vaults, and `totalIdle` is the amount of idle assets (WETH) sitting around in the `LMPVault` contract. Both values are potentially outdated during deposits, thus leading to "incorrect" `LMPVault` share calculations. `totalDebt` and `totalIdle` is updated by [calling the `LMPVault.updateDebtReporting` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L795).

```solidity
304: function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {
305:     return totalIdle + totalDebt;
306: }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

During `LMPVault` deposits, the number of shares to be minted should be calculated based on the up-to-date destination vault debt (including PnL). However, having to update the debt reporting for all destinations on every deposit might not be very gas efficient. At the time of the submission, I'm not aware of any other, gas efficient, way to mitigate this issue.
