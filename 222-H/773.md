# Destination vault rewards should be claimed before every withdrawal in LMPVault
## Summary
An `LMPVault` user will loose some base assets while withdrawing as pending rewards from the destination vaults are not being claimed before a LMPVault withdraw. Because of this a user will receive less baseAssets then what he should receive.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. In `withdraw` and `redeem` functions of `LMPVault` the pending rewards that the vault has in destination vault rewarder are not being considered when calculating share value.
2. Due to this a user who is withdrawing funds will loose his share of rewards that the `LMPVault` has earned  from the point where the last  debt report is occured to now.

## Impact

A user who is withdrawing funds from the LMPVault will loose some share of his rewards.

## Recommendation
Claim pending rewards from all the destination vaults and add it to the `totalIdle` before calculating share price in `withdraw` and redeem functions.
