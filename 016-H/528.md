# Incorrect Configuration for Curve read Re-entrancy checks
## Summary
Devs have falsely assumed that a contract that returns WETH address in CurvePool.get_coins call will not be vulnerable to read-reentrancy. Conic Finance recently got rekt for $3.5 million for making the same assumption(check tools used for more details).
## Vulnerability Detail
POC is as follows- 
1. Attacker creates a malicious contract, takes rETH flashloan from balancer
2. In balancer callback he swaps out all rETH for WETH in the rETH-ETH pool on curve, then call add_liquidity, adds some weth back to curvePool, now remove_liquidity but with use_eth boolean set to true.
3. Now in the callback the virtual_price of rETH-ETH LP has been manipulated and attacker can now very easily interact with tokemak contracts making them loose out on funds as there will be no read- reentrancy checks if coins[0] & coins[1] are not 0xEeeeeE...... as the pool returns weth and reth addresses in get_coins. 


## Impact
Oracle price manipulation leading to loss of funds.
## Code Snippet
[L-120 CurveV2CryptoEthOracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/CurveV2CryptoEthOracle.sol#L120-L123)
```solidity
        // Only need ability to check for read-only reentrancy for pools containing native Eth.
        if (checkReentrancy) {
            if (tokens[0] != ETH && tokens[1] != ETH) revert MustHaveEthForReentrancy();
        }
```

## Recommendation

Do reentrancy checks for WETH pools as well , specially meta pools as they have a remove_liquidity function with use_eth boolean as user input.
