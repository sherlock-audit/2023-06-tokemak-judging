# Curve pool reentrancy check doesn't work for some pools which lead to draining of funds
## Summary
Curve pool reentrancy check doesn't work for some pools which leads to draining
## Vulnerability Detail
From there [post mortem](https://medium.com/@ConicFinance/post-mortem-eth-and-crvusd-omnipool-exploits-c9c7fa213a3d)
>Our assumption was that Curve v2 pools using ETH have the ETH address (0xeeeâ€¦eee) as one of their coins. However, they instead have the WETH address. This led to `_isETH` returning false, and in turn, to the reentrancy guard of the rETH pool being bypassed.

E.x. in the readme there is

> Curve stETH/ETH concentrated: 0x828b154032950C8ff7CF8085D841723Db2696056

if you will go to [contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x828b154032950c8ff7cf8085d841723db2696056#readContract) and see coins
it will use 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2 instead of 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE

Same for this 0x6c38cE8984a890F5e46e6dF6117C26b3F1EcfC9C and maybe some others.

```solidity
            if (iToken == LibAdapter.CURVE_REGISTRY_ETH_ADDRESS_POINTER) {
                if (poolInfo.checkReentrancy == 1) {
                    // This will fail in reentrancy
                    ICurveOwner(pool.owner()).withdraw_admin_fees(address(pool));
                }
            }
```

## Recommendation
Check for WETH in reentrency
