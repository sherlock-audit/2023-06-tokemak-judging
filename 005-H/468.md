# Lost rewards in `LMPVault` when withdrawing underlying from destination vaults
## Summary
All rewards from the destination vault rewarders are lost when withdrawing in `LMPVault` and the assets pulled are bigger than the assets to pull (when there is not enough idle).

## Vulnerability Detail
When there is not enough idle in `LMPVault`, [`redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L422) or [`withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L400) will call [`withdrawBaseAsset()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L483) of the destination vaults in the withdrawal queue.

In the `withdrawBaseAsset()` calls, the rewards from the rewarder of the destination vault will also be claimed and accumulated in [`info.idleIncrease`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L487).

However, when `info.totalAssetsPulled` is bigger than `info.totalAssetsToPull`, the variable `info.idleIncrease` will be [overwritten](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L494), ignoring any accumulated rewards from destination vaults.

## Impact
Lost reward tokens, would result in much less yield. The exact amount depends on triggering `info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull`, which should be very frequent as the shares to burn [round up](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L290) in `LMPDebt`. See the POC below as an example.

## Code Snippet
Add the following test as a POC to `LMPVault-Withdraw.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_POC_lostRewards_whenTotalAssetsPulled_biggerThan_totalAssetsToPull() public {
    _accessController.grantRole(Roles.SOLVER_ROLE, address(this));
    _accessController.grantRole(Roles.LMP_FEE_SETTER_ROLE, address(this));

    // User is going to deposit 1000 asset
    _asset.mint(address(this), 1000);
    _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);
    _lmpVault.deposit(1000, address(this));

    // Deployed 1000 asset to DV1
    _underlyerOne.mint(address(this), 500);
    _underlyerOne.approve(address(_lmpVault), 500);
    _lmpVault.rebalance(
        address(_destVaultOne),
        address(_underlyerOne), // tokenIn
        500,
        address(0), // destinationOut, none when sending out baseAsset
        address(_asset), // baseAsset, tokenOut
        1000
    );

    // rewards accrue in the destination vault
    // mocking here the accrual for sake of the POC
    _accessController.grantRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE, address(this));
    _asset.mint(address(this), 1000);
    _asset.approve(_destVaultOne.rewarder(), 1000);
    MainRewarder(_destVaultOne.rewarder()).queueNewRewards(1000);

    vm.roll(block.number + 100);

    _lmpVault.redeem(999, address(this), address(this));

    assertEq(_lmpVault.totalIdle(), 1);
    assertEq(_asset.balanceOf(address(_lmpVault)), 101);
}
```
The `_baseAsset` rewards are stored in the `LMPVault`, but not accounted for in `totalIdle`. Thus, as it is impossible to retrieve these tokens (they are tracked and there is no functionality to withdraw them), they will be permanently lost.

## Recommendation
Account for the accumulated idle increase, by replacing `=` with `+=`, as following:
```solidity
info.idleIncrease += info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;
```
