# Rewards sent by destinationVault during withdrawal can be locked forever inside lmpVault


## Summary
DestinationVault sent rewards(in baseAsset) should be recorded in idle of lmpVault. But there is an error which overwrites the 'info.idleIncrease' state during withdrawals, resulting in the rewards being lost forever as they cant be recovered by recovery role either due to being trackedTokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
485:                 // Destination Vault rewards will be transferred to us as part of burning out shares
486:                 // Back into what that amount is and make sure it gets into idle
487:                 info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
488:                 info.totalAssetsPulled += assetPulled;
489:                 info.debtDecrease += totalDebtBurn;
490: 
491:                 // It's possible we'll get back more assets than we anticipate from a swap
492:                 // so if we do, throw it in idle and stop processing. You don't get more than we've calculated
493:                 if (info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull) {
494:                     info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull; ///@audit < line 487 is overwritten
495:                     info.totalAssetsPulled = info.totalAssetsToPull;
496:                     break;
497:                 }
```

In the above snippet code execution reaches line 494 if the swapper sent us more tokens than expected, the line 494 overwrites the cumulative effect of line 487 which is responsible for accounting of rewards recieved . Which leads to some baseAsset being stuck forever in lmpVault.

## Impact
Irrecoverably stuck funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
line 494 should be 
```solidity
info.idleIncrease +=  info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull
```

this way the rewards sent by dv + some extra tokens sent by swapper both are accounted for.
