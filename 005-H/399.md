# LMPVault.sol: Incorrect calculation of `idleIncrease` in `_withdraw`.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
`LMPVault's` `totalIdle` represents the amount not invested in other vaults.

On `withdraw`, the destination vault's reward may be sent and return more than the withdrawal requested.
Include it as idle with the logic below.
```solidity
info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
```
If `info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull` is satisfied, set `info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;` 

which doesn't take into account the `idleIncrease` value we were accumulating above.

This can lead to a problem where the quantity that should actually be measured as idle is not reflected.

This can affect the capital efficiency of the protocol.
## Impact
affect the capital efficiency of the protocol.
