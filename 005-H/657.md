# LMPVault._withdraw may cause some idleIncrease to be ignored, causing _baseAsset to get stuck in LMPVault
## Summary

Users can withdraw _baseAsset(WETH) via LMPVault.[[withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L400)]/[[redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L422)], which call [[_withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L448)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L448) internally. If `totalIdle` is less than the amount the user wants to withdraw, then `_withdraw` will withdraw enough _baseAsset from destVault via [[destVault.withdrawBaseAsset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L483)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L483). The current implementation of `_deposit` causes [[info.idleIncrease to be overridden](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L494)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L494).

L470-505, the `for` loop processes each `destVault` in the `withdrawalQueue` array until the pulled funds are sufficient or all are traversed.

L482, get the current balance of `_baseAsset`. 

L483, call `destVault.withdrawBaseAsset` to pull funds. The `assetPulled` is the actual amount of `_baseAsset` that was transferred to the caller (LMPVault).

L487, `info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled`. According to the above code, `_baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled` should be 0, but why is it accumulated here? Let's figure it out first. 

`destVault.withdrawBaseAsset` will call [[_burn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L250)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L250) internally. As we all know, in the standard ERC20 implementation(from openzeppelin), `_burn` will call `_beforeTokenTransfer` and `_afterTokenTransfer` internally. And DestinationVault overrides these two functions.

```solidity
File: v2-core-audit-2023-07-14\src\vault\DestinationVault.sol
335:     function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
336:         if (from == to) {
337:             return;
338:         }
339: 
340:         if (from != address(0)) {
341:->           _rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
342:         }
343:     }
```

L341, [[_rewarder.withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L73-L84)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L73-L84) is called, and the third argument is set to true to indicate claiming reward token. And the reward token of _rewarder is _baseAsset(WETH). These rewards are distributed via `LiquidationRow.liquidateVaultsForToken`.

Now let's go back to the previous code. Whenever `destVault.withdrawBaseAsset` is called, destVault will distribute rewards to the caller. So the WETH distributed by rewarder of each destVault will be accumulated to `info.idleIncrease`. However, when the `if` condition of L493 is met, L494 `info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull` wrongly overwrites `info.idleIncrease`. **This caused the WETH distributed by the rewarder to be erased, and these funds will be stuck in LMPVault and will not be included in `totalIdle`**.

## Impact

When `withdraw`/`redeem` is called, WETH distributed by the rewarder may be stuck in LMPVault and will not be included in `totalIdle`.
