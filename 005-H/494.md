# In `LMPVault::_withdraw`, rewards will be locked, if more assets than needed are received
## Summary

Due to accounting logic error in the `LMPVault::_withdraw`, rewards sent by the destination vaults will be trapped when more assets are received than the `totalAssetsToPull` (due to favorable swap, etc).

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L484-L497

The `LMPVault::_withdraw` calls the `IDestinationVault.withdrawBaseAsset` in a loop. 
As the comment says (line 485-486), upon burning the shares, the DestinationVaults will transfer back some rewards to the `LMPVault`,
therefore the increased balance due to the rewards is correctly accounted in the line 487.
However, in the case where more asset is sent than the `info.totalAssetsToPull`, the `info.idleIncrease` is mistakenly overwritten to be the surplus, instead of incrementing it by the surplus (line 494).


```solidity
// LMPVault::_withdraw
482                 uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
483                 uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));
484
485                 // Destination Vault rewards will be transferred to us as part of burning out shares
486                 // Back into what that amount is and make sure it gets into idle
487                 info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
488                 info.totalAssetsPulled += assetPulled;
489                 info.debtDecrease += totalDebtBurn;
490
491                 // It's possible we'll get back more assets than we anticipate from a swap
492                 // so if we do, throw it in idle and stop processing. You don't get more than we've calculated
493                 if (info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull) {
494                     info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;
495                     info.totalAssetsPulled = info.totalAssetsToPull;
496                     break;
497                 }
```


## Impact

As the result, when the following conditions are met:
1. there is some rewards sent from destination vaults to the LMPVault
1. more asset is pulled than the `info.totalAssetsToPull` (due to favorable swap and so on)

the rewards sent from the destination vaults are not correctly accounted, and therefore trapped in the `LMPVault`.
Since the rewards are in the baseAsset, which is tracked, it cannot be rescued.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The line 494 in the LMPVault should be corrected to add the surplus to the idleIncrease, rather than overwriting it.

```solidity
- 494                     info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;
+			  info.idleIncrease += info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;
```
