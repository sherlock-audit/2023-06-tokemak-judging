# Incorrect Handling of Rewards During Asset Withdrawal from Destinations
## Summary
The `_withdraw` function contains an issue in the way rewards accrued during asset withdrawal from destination vaults are accounted for. Specifically, when the assets pulled are greater than the assets intended to be pulled (`info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull`), the code incorrectly calculates the `idleIncrease` by subtracting the intended assets from the pulled assets. This approach fails to account for the rewards earned during the process, potentially leading to inaccurate `idleIncrease` and potential financial losses.
## Vulnerability Detail
Within the _withdraw function, rewards are earned during the withdrawal process while burning the shares in destination vaults. This reward should be accounted in `totalIdle`

But when `info.totalAssetsPulled` exceeds `info.totalAssetsToPull`, the code calculates idleIncrease as follows:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L493-L494

However, this calculation does not consider the rewards that were received during the withdrawal([`see line 487`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L487)). As a result, the `idleIncrease` value does not accurately reflect the actual rewards earned.
## Impact
Current logic fails to account for the rewards earned during the withdrawal process, potentially leading to inaccurate `idleIncrease` and potential financial losses

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Following chnages should be implementaed
```solidity
    if (info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull) {
----        info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull; 
+++        info.idleIncrease += info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;
```
