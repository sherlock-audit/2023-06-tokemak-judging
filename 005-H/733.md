# `totalIdle` may updated wrongly due to uncounted asset rewards from burned shares, affecting rebalance and resulting untracked asset
## Summary

`totalIdle` may updated wrongly due to uncounted asset rewards from burned shares when `totalAssetsPulled > totalAssetsToPull`. This wrong `totalIdle` will affect rebalance, and this also may be categorized as loss asset due to untracked asset

## Vulnerability Detail

When there is a withdrawal, and the idle asset is less than amount requested from the withdrawal, the asset will be pulled from DVs, which is going through loop of withdrawalQueue.

On every loop, (assuming `sharesToBurn` != 0), on line 487, the `idleIncrease` is accumulated with the difference betwen current asset balance minus asset before withdrawing from DV (preBalance) minus the `assetPulled` value. As said in the comment, this idleIncrease is part of rewards from burned shares.

Then on line 488, the `totalAssetsPulled` is accumulated with the `assetPulled`

```js
File: LMPVault.sol
482:                 uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
483:                 uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));
484:
485:                 // Destination Vault rewards will be transferred to us as part of burning out shares
486:                 // Back into what that amount is and make sure it gets into idle
487:                 info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
488:                 info.totalAssetsPulled += assetPulled;
489:                 info.debtDecrease += totalDebtBurn;
490:
491:                 // It's possible we'll get back more assets than we anticipate from a swap
492:                 // so if we do, throw it in idle and stop processing. You don't get more than we've calculated
493:                 if (info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull) {
494:                     info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;
495:                     info.totalAssetsPulled = info.totalAssetsToPull;
496:                     break;
497:                 }
498:
...
511:         // subtract what's taken out of idle from totalIdle
512:         // slither-disable-next-line events-maths
513:         totalIdle = info.currentIdle + info.idleIncrease - info.assetsFromIdle;
514:
```

The issue here is, one of loop breaker, which is when `info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull`, the `idleIncrease` is assigned (overwritten) with `totalAssetsPulled - totalAssetsToPull`. This is an issue because `totalAssetsPulled` is only incremented with `assetPulled`, the rewards asset from burned shares is not included or omitted.

Finally on line 513, the totalIdle will be the `idleIncrease`, which is wrong, because the previous `idleIncrease` by reward (from burned shares) is omitted. Thus the reward (from burned share) is untracked.

This wrong `totalIdle` will finally affecting rebalance, as this variable is being used in rebalance.

## Impact

Untracked asset in the contract, can make `totalIdle` is less than actual `idle` asset. This can affecting rebalance, as this `totalIdle` variable is being used in rebalance. Untracked asset (in term of accounting) might be considered as a 'lost' asset.

## Recommendation

Include the `rewards` from burned shares to `totalAssetsPulled`
