# Balancer's read-only re-entrancy is not checked as it should be.
## Summary
Balancer's read-only re-entrancy is not checked as it should be.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, Tokemak are checking for Balancers read-only  re-entrancy by calling:

```solidity
  (, bytes memory returnData) = balancerVault.staticcall(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IVault.manageUserBalance.selector, new IVault.UserBalanceOp[](0))
        );
        if (keccak256(returnData) == REENTRANCY_ERROR_HASH) {
            revert BalancerVaultReentrancy();
        }
```

This is not the correct way to do it, neither balancer recommend this. Not following balancer's recommendation to solve the issue, might cause problems in the future. Like new pools being updated and not triggering the re-entrancy check on `manageUserBalance` function.

## Recommendation

Do use the mitigation that balancer provides, not a custom one:

You can see the guide here: https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/advanced/valuing-bpt/valuing-bpt.html#on-chain-price-evaluation

Basically you should call: `ensureNotInVaultContext(vault)`, not `manageUserBalance`
