# Staking reward calculation error
## Summary

Due to the wrong calculation of staking rewards, users will get a reward as soon as they staking

## Vulnerability Detail

### call path
LMPVault.deposit(mint)->_transferAndMint->_mint->_afterTokenTransfer->MainRewarder(ExtraRewarder).stake->_updateReward->earned

### _afterTokenTransfer
The staking reward is calculated after casting, as follows: _afterTokenTransfer function, the call path in the stake function is: stake->_updateReward, the code to be noted is marked as  // found
```solidity
    function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
        // Nothing to do really do here
        if (from == to) {
            return;
        }

        // If this isn't a burn, then the recipient should be earning in the rewarder
        // "Stake" the tokens there so they start earning
        if (to != address(0)) {
            rewarder.stake(to, amount);   // found
        }
    }
```
### stake

Calling the _updateReward function in the stake, IExtraRewarder.stake also has the same problem

```solidity
    function stake(address account, uint256 amount) public onlyStakeTracker {
        _updateReward(account); // found
        _stake(account, amount);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < extraRewards.length; ++i) {
            IExtraRewarder(extraRewards[i]).stake(account, amount); // found
        }
    }
```
### _updateReward
In the _updateReward function, update how much the user earns and the value of rewardPerTokenStored. Take the user’s first pledge as an example. Now userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]=0, then start calculating the income and call the earned function

```solidity
    function _updateReward(address account) internal {
        uint256 earnedRewards = 0;
        rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken();
        lastUpdateBlock = lastBlockRewardApplicable();

        if (account != address(0)) {
            earnedRewards = earned(account); // found
            rewards[account] = earnedRewards;
            userRewardPerTokenPaid[account] = rewardPerTokenStored;
        }

        emit UserRewardUpdated(account, earnedRewards, rewardPerTokenStored, lastUpdateBlock);
    }
```
### earned
In the earned function, the user balance is obtained. Since the pledge is made in _afterTokenTransfer, the balance is greater than 0 at this time, userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]=0, and as long as rewardPerTokenStored is greater than 0, the returned result will be greater than 0, as long as the reward is distributed or in the queue The reward in rewardPerTokenStored will be greater than 0, and now the user gets an income as soon as the assets are pledged and make a cash withdrawal

```solidity

    function earned(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
        return (balanceOf(account) * (rewardPerToken() - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]) / 1e18) + rewards[account]; // found
    }

```

## Impact

Users can profit by repeatedly staking assets

## Recommendation

Don’t count assets just deposited into rewards
