# _beforeTokenTransfer() Missing call MainRewarder._updateReward
## Summary
The `MainRewarder.userRewardPerTokenPaid[user]` needs to be updated before the balance of the `DestinationVault` changes
This will ensure that the rewards are correct

But currently `DestinationVault._beforeTokenTransfer()` doesn't modify `to`'s `userRewardPerTokenPaid[to]`
triggers it in `_afterTokenTransfer()`, which modifies `userRewardPerTokenPaid[to]` after `to`'s balance has changed.

This results in `to` being able to get unreasonable `rewards`, draining the contract of all rewards

## Vulnerability Detail

The user's rewards are accumulated by `userRewardPerTokenPaid[to]`
So before there is a change in the user's balance, be sure to change the accumulated rewards and change `userRewardPerTokenPaid[user]=rewardPerTokenStored `  first
This will ensure that the number of rewards for the user is correct

Currently the user balance of `MainRewarder.sol` is equal to the balance of `DestinationVault`

```solidity
abstract contract AbstractRewarder is IBaseRewarder, SecurityBase {
...
    function balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
        return stakeTracker.balanceOf(account);
    }

```
 
So before the user balance of `DestinationVault` changes, `MainRewarder._updateReward()` needs to be triggered to adjust the `userRewardPerTokenPaid[user]`

Currently `DestinationVault` is implemented as follows.

```solidity
abstract contract DestinationVault is SecurityBase, ERC20, Initializable, IDestinationVault {
...

    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
        if (from == to) {
            return;
        }

        if (from != address(0)) {
@>          _rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
        }
    }

    function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
        if (from == to) {
            return;
        }
        if (to != address(0)) {
@>          _rewarder.stake(to, amount);
        }
    }
```
From the code above we know that
` _rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);` is called before the balance changes
`withdraw()` would trigger ` MainRewarder._updateReward(from)`

but doesn't trigger `to`

In `_afterTokenTransfer()` it will execute ` _rewarder.stake(to, amount);`, `stake()` will trigger `MainRewarder._updateReward(to)`.

The problem is: `_afterTokenTransfer()` is called when the balance of `to` has already been increased, at which point the reward of `to` will be much larger than the correct value.

Example.
rewardPerTokenStored = 100
userRewardPerTokenPaid[alice]=0
DestinationVault.banalces[alice]=0

when execute DestinationVault.transfer(alice,50):

Since `MainRewarder._updateReward(to)` is not triggered in `_beforeTokenTransfer()`
So it becomes:
userRewardPerTokenPaid[alice]=0
DestinationVault.banalces[alice]=50


 when execute `_afterTokenTransfer()` , at this time `DestinationVault.banalces[alice]=50`

`_afterTokenTransfer()`   -> ` _rewarder.stake(to, amount);` -> `MainRewarder._updateReward(to)`

This way alice's reward is
earned = DestinationVault.banalces[alice] * (rewardPerTokenStored -userRewardPerTokenPaid[alice])
             = 50 * (100 - 0 )
             = 50000

The correct alice reward should be 0


 Note: `LMPVault.sol` has a similar problem

## Impact

Incorrect triggering of `_updateReward()`, leading to possible theft of rewards

```solidity

...
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
        if (from == to) {
            return;
        }

        if (from != address(0)) {
            _rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
        }

+       if (to != address(0)) {
+            _rewarder.stake(to, 0);
+       }   

 }
```
