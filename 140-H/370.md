# Rewards incorrectly use new stake amount when calculating rewards from previous periods
## Summary
When a new amount is staked in the `MainRewarder`, it calculates the rewards of the previous period taking into account the new stake. The correct behaviour would be to only account the new stake in the period after which the stake is done, not also before. This error would allow anyone to steal all the rewards accrued over the past duration. Notice the difference to the [original implementation](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/cvxRewardPool.sol#L174).

## Vulnerability Detail
The `MainRewarder` lets the `StakeTracker` contract call [`stake()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L86) and [`withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L73). 

The `StakeTracker` is going to be either a [`DestinationVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L351) or [`LMPVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L863), which stake inside the `_afterTokenTransfer()` function. 

When this function is called (in [`_transfer()`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/0457042d93d9dfd760dbaa06a4d2f1216fdbe297/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L247)), the balances of the accounts and the `totalSupply()` have already been updated, such that the function call to `stake()` of the `Rewarder`, will update the previous rewards in [`_updateReward()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L87) with additional amounts, leading to extra rewards.

## Impact
This bug can be abused to steal all rewards, consider the following attack:
- `n` blocks have passed, equaling `r` rewards
- attacker deposits into vault, which stakes and accrues rewards from the previous `n` blocks with the new deposited amount `a`
- attacker then transfers the shares of the vault to another address, which withdraws from the original account and stakes again on the new account. The new account will receive the same new rewards as if it had staked in the previous `n` blocks.
- repeat transfer to another address until all the rewards have been drained.

## Code Snippet
Wrote the following POC in `RewardVault.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_POC_stakeAttributesRewards_fromPreviousDurations() public {
    vm.roll(block.number + 100);

    // stakes now, but gets rewards from previous duration
    // would have the same problem if a stake was triggered by a vault deposit
    // as the balance would be updated before the stake function call
    // which would result in rewards being earned via _updateReward() in stake().
    vm.prank(address(stakeTracker));
    mainRewardVault.stake(RANDOM, amount);

    uint256 earned = mainRewardVault.earned(RANDOM);
    assertEq(earned, amount);

    uint256 rewardBalanceBefore = mainReward.balanceOf(RANDOM);
    uint256 extraReward1BalanceBefore = extraReward1.balanceOf(RANDOM);
    uint256 extraReward2BalanceBefore = extraReward2.balanceOf(RANDOM);

    vm.prank(RANDOM);
    mainRewardVault.getReward();

    uint256 rewardBalanceAfter = mainReward.balanceOf(RANDOM);
    uint256 extraReward1BalanceAfter = extraReward1.balanceOf(RANDOM);
    uint256 extraReward2BalanceAfter = extraReward2.balanceOf(RANDOM);

    assertEq(rewardBalanceAfter - rewardBalanceBefore, amount);
    assertEq(extraReward1BalanceAfter - extraReward1BalanceBefore, amount);
    assertEq(extraReward2BalanceAfter - extraReward2BalanceBefore, amount);
}
```
Notice that the stake is performed after the 100 blocks have passed, but the address `RANDOM` still gets all the rewards as if it had been there from the beginning. Thus, it enables the previously mentioned attack of moving tokens to new addresses and claiming extra rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`_updateRewards()` should calculate the rewards from the previous period with the `totalSupply()` and `balanceOf(account)` before the new staked amount. It does it correctly for the account that is losing the tokens, but not for the one receiving them. Consider adding an `updateRewards(address account)` external function and call it with the `to` address in `_beforeTokenTransfer()`. Then, `stake()` can skip the `_updateReward()` call.
