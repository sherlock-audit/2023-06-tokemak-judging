# Users can steal reward tokens due to bad update of rewardDebt in `LMPVault.sol`.
## Summary

Users can steal reward tokens due to bad update of rewardDebt in `LMPVault.sol`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract `LMPVault.sol` is an erc20 contract and the tokens are automatically staked in the rewarder contract to earn continuous rewards. The staking mechanism is carried out in the `_beforeTokenTransfer` and `_afterTokenTransfer` functions.

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount){
    rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
}

function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount){
    rewarder.stake(to, amount);
}
```

The `stake` and `withdraw` functions update the user's rewardDebt in the `Mainrewarder.sol` contract.

```solidity
function stake(address account, uint256 amount) public onlyStakeTracker {
    _updateReward(account); // <------------ Updates rewardDebt
    _stake(account, amount);
```

The issue is that the reward debt of the `to` user should also be updated in the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function, and not after the token transfer. This is because after the token transfer, the `to` user already has a non-zero balance, and their rewardDebt is calculated on a non-zero balance for the first time.

Assume Alice is sending 100 LMPVault tokens to Bob, and Bob has currently a balance of 0.

1. Bob gets transferred the 100 tokens. Now, balanceOf[Bob] = 100.
2. The `_afterTokenTransfer` function is called after the token transfer happens. The `rewarder.stake(Bob,100)` is called.
3. Inside the `stake` function, `_updateReward(Bob)` is called.
4. The `earnedRewards` value is calculated. This is done in the `earned(Bob)` function in `AbstractRewarder.sol` contract, as shown below.
5. As shown below, since Bob already has the tokens transferred, and has `balanceOf(Bob)` as non-zero.
6. Bob's `userRewardPerTokenPaid` is still 0, since this is their fisrt time calculating rewards. Thus Bob earns a large amount of rewards immediately after receiving the tokens.

```solidity
function earned(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
    return ((balanceOf(account) * (rewardPerToken() - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account])) / 1e18) + rewards[account];
}
```

So Bob is able to get a bunch of rewards in the same block as their first transaction. This is because by the time `_updateReward` is called, Bob has already received the tokens and has a non-zero balance.

## Impact

Bad token accounting, allowing Bob to steal reward tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Trigger `_updateReward` for Bob before transferring in the tokens. In the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function, add an update statement.

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount){
    rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
    rewarder.stake(to,0); // <------------ Updates rewardDebt before transferring tokens. Actual amount will be taken care of in the `afterTokenTransfer` function
}
```
