# `rewardPerToken` calculation is incorrect, resulting in a smaller distribution of the user's reward than intended.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
`LMPVault` automatically `stakes` and `unstakes` via `_beforeTokenTransfer` and `_afterTokenTransfer` when a `deposit`, `withdrawal`, or `transfer` occurs.

In the case of a `deposit`, `LMPVault` will `mint` the token and then `stake` it in `_afterTokenTransfer`.
**This means that the `balance` of `totalSupply` and `msg.sender` has been increased.**

The `stake` causes a call to `_updateReward` and a call to `rewardPerToken()` to calculate the accumulated reward.

```solidity
function rewardPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 total = totalSupply();
        if (total == 0) {
            return rewardPerTokenStored;
        }        
        return rewardPerTokenStored + ((lastBlockRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateBlock) * rewardRate * 1e18 / total);
    }
```

Since it was called from `_afterTokenTransfer`, `totalSupply` has already increased. Therefore, the freshly minted quantity is included in the accumulated reward calculation.

Therefore, a value greater than the `totalSupply` that should actually be rewarded is set to `total`, which affects how much other users get.

## Impact
`rewardPerToken` calculation is incorrect, resulting in a smaller distribution of the user's reward than intended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If it takes a rewardPerToken amount as an argument and is freshly minted, it should decrement total by amount.
