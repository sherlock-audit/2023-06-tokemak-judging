# Rewarders can be drained
## Summary

The rewarder contracts are heavily based on the Synthetix rewarder. However, contrary to Synthetix, here the staking is done and tracked in an external contract (the stakeTracker), and the rewarder contract just keeps track of the rewards. Because not all actions of the stakeTracker do update the reward state in the right moment, a mismatch between the _totalSupply_ and _balanceOf_ values of the stakeTracker can be crafted and abused, and an attacker can inflate its own rewards and drain all rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

Relevant to understand this vulnerability are these functions in the `AbstractRewarder.sol` contract (which is inherited by the `MainRewarder.sol` contract) and their interactions:

1. `_updateReward(address)`
2. `rewardPerTokenStored()`
3. `earned(address)`

Another central element is the _stakeTracker_. According to the Discord messages of the protocol team, the _stakeTracker_ will be "either the LMPVault or the DestinationVault", we will assume an `LMPVault` here. 

The rewarder is looking up the total supply and the balance of a user by accessing the according functions (`totalSupply()`, `balanceOf(address)`) of the vault.

`earned(address)` is calculating the amount of rewards earned by an account, `rewardPerToken()` calculates the current reward per token value. They are both view functions and therefore do not modify the state.
`_updateReward(address)` uses these to functions and updates reward state variables - _rewardPerTokenStored_, _rewards[account]_ and _userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]_.

`rewardPerToken()` is taking `totalSupply()` into account, whereas `earned(address)` is taking `balanceOf(address)` into account. 
`rewardPerToken()` is executed by `earned(address)`, so there is an implied assumption in the code, that these to values (the total supply and the user balance) are always balanced - when a user deposits tokens into the vault, the balance of his account will increase, but also the total supply will increase, which will reduce the reward per share. 
This relation is not linear - as with a growing balance also the relative proportion of it grows and the account should get more rewards, but for example a doubling of the staked tokens of a user will not double his rewards. The increase of reward per additional staked token slows down and is capped to the rewardRate as a maximum (per reward time unit, a block in the case of Tokemak).

However, looking at the calculation of `rewardPerToken()` [(link),](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L180) we notice that the current "old" _rewardPerTokenStored_ value is taken, and increased by a dynamic calculation to calculate the "new" value. The total supply is only taken into account in the second part. We also notice, that the "unrewarded" time (in number of blocks) is calculated using the _lastUpdateBlock_ storage value (which is then also updated to the current block). 
However, when the function is run a second time in a block, this calculation results to 0, which then makes the division by the total supply useless (the result of the dynamic part will always be 0) and the function just returns the old _rewardPerTokenStored_ value. 

In other words - if the `_updateReward(address)` function is run more than once a block, then the assumption that the values of `totalSupply()` and `balanceOf(address)` are updated and current is broken!
An attacker can craft a situation where his balance is inflated to a high value, but the total supply is not updated, so that **the calculated reward is bigger than his fair share, but also bigger than the block reward and can include all the available rewards.**


For clarification an example workflow of such an attack scenario:

Requirements:
1. The vault uses an easy to get base asset (ideally availably via a flash loan), and the connected rewarder has enough rewards to steal :) 
2. Because of this code in the `earned(address)` function `(rewardPerToken() - userRewardPerTokenPaid[address])` the attacker must have his _userRewardPerTokenPaid[address]_ value not updated (which is done in the `_updateReward(address)` function) - therefore the must be at least one block without having the `_updatereward(address)` function run from his account.
3. The `_updateReward(address)` function must be run by another account to update the _rewardPerTokenStored_ value. This can of course also be done by the attacker using a contract. The simplest way would be to run the `getReward()` function in `MainRewarder.sol`, as it is an external function. 

Then, in the same block (or transaction) as the update in requirement 3 is done, the attacker calls the `deposit(uint256, address)` function to deposit the base asset. 
This function then calcualtes the amount of shares and calls the `_transferAndMint(uint256, uint256, address)` function, which first transfers the assets to the vault, adds them to the idle assets and mints the according shares. The contract also implements the `_beforeTokenTransfer(address, address, uint256)` and `_afterTokenTransfer(address, address, uint256)` hooks, which are run before/after any transfer (including minting and burning). 
Whereas `_beforeTokenTransfer(address, address, uint256)` does not taking any action during minting, `_afterTokenTransfer(address, address, uint256)` calls the `stake(address, uint256)` function of the rewarder (implemented in `MainRewarder.sol`). Note here that this is done after minting, so the balance of the account has already be updated. 
The stake function then runs the `_updateReward(address)` function - which does NOT take into account the new total supply when calcualting _rewardPerTokenStored_ via the `rewardPerToken()` function, but DOES take into account the new balance of the account when calculating `earnedRewards(address)` using the `earned(address)` function. **The reward amount is therefore inflated and can be as big as all available rewards.** The calculated rewards for the account are then stored.

The attacker can then call the `getReward()` function of the rewarder. Here the `_updateReward(address)` function gets called again, but it is not relevant and has not effect (if still in the same transaction/block, then the users _userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]_ has been updated already and no additional payout is done; if already in another block, then _rewardPerTokenStored_  will be updated with the new `totalSupply()` value).

The attacker can then also withdraw the base asset from the vault.
As this scenario can be executed in one transaction, an attacker can also use a flash loan to maximaze impact.

If the attack is successful, there could be further issues, like in the case of being `GPToke` the reward token, which can be automatically staked by the rewarder and gives the attacker additional rewards, etc.

## Impact

All rewards can be drained for no or low (in case of using a flash loan) costs.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The mismatch between the `balanceOf(address)` and `totalSupply()` cannot be prevented, but if the `_updateReward(address)` function for the user is run before any supply and balance changing actions are done, then the _userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]_ value will be updated and the `earned(address)` function for the account will zero out the balance value and just return the previously stored rewards value.
For this, the `_updateReward(address)` function must be made callable by the _stakeTracker_ (for example by implementing a wrapper function with the `onlyStakeTracker` modifier), and it must be called first in any supply and balance changing actions, `_beforeTokenTransfer(address, address, uint256)` would be a good point for the above described attack scenario.
