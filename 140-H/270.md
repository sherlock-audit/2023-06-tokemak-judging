# Rewards can be drained due to incorrect handling of `userRewardPerTokenPaid` accounting
## Summary

The [AbstractRewarder.userRewardPerTokenPaid](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L69-L70) mapping is updated too late on mint/deposit and inbound transfer of vault shares which enables a malicious user to drain the rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

### Reward accounting
The [AbstractRewarder.userRewardPerTokenPaid](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L69-L70) mapping holds the return value of [AbstractRewarder.rewardPerToken()](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L169-L181) for a user since the last call to [AbstractRewarder._updateReward(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L124-L140).  In case of a new unrelated user account, the mapping holds tha value `0`.  

Therefore, it's crucial that [AbstractRewarder._updateReward(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L124-L140) is called **before** vault shares are **transferred** or freshly **minted** (includes deposit) to a user, otherwise the reward accounting, see [AbstractRewarder.earned(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L183-L206), will act as if the user had the shares since the beginning (`userRewardPerTokenPaid` mapping holds `0`) or since the last call to  [AbstractRewarder._updateReward(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L124-L140) when `userRewardPerTokenPaid` was updated.

### Vault reward handling

The `LMPVault` handles the reward accounting on mint/redeem/deposit/withdraw and transfer of shares using ERC-20 transfer hooks:
* [LMPVault._beforeTokenTransfer(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L834-L852) handles redeem/withdraw and outbound transfer of shares. It **correctly** withdraws all the rewards (main + extra) the user is eligible for, see [L844](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L844) and [MainRewarder.withdraw(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L73-L84).
* [LMPVault._afterTokenTransfer(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L854-L865) handles mint/deposit and inbound transfer of shares. It **incorreclty** stakes the shares and rewards become available **immediately** due to the above `Reward accounting` pitfall, i.e. [AbstractRewarder._updateReward(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L124-L140) is called **after** shares arrived at user account, see [L863](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L863) and [MainRewarder.stake(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L86-L93 ).

Moreover, the [DestinationVault](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L335-L354) has the same issue and due to the analogy, this report is solely focused on the explanation, PoC and solution in the case of `LMPVault`.

## Impact

The above vulnerability leads to the following consequences:
1. A new user who **deposits** (includes mint) base assets into a vault is eligible for rewards as if he had staked them since the beginning, i.e. **loss of rewards** for the protocol.
2. A user can **transfer** his vault shares to another new user, thereby he gets his rewards while the new user is also immediately eligible for rewards as if he had staked them since the beginning. By transferring the shares to the next new user and so on, all the **rewards can be drained** from the protocol.

## Code Snippet

The following PoC modifies the existing test case `LMPVaultMintingTests .test_deposit_StartsEarningWhileStillReceivingToken()` in order to prove the above claims:
1. Initial depositor claims rewards immediately after deposit (same rewards as depositor who waited for `10 000` blocks)
2. Initial depositor transfers vault shares to other user who can immediately claim the same rewards again
3. Other user transfers vault shares to next other user who is immediately eligible for the same rewards again

Just apply the *diff* below and run the test with `forge test -vv --match-test test_deposit_StartsEarningWhileStillReceivingToken`:

## Recommendation

Make sure the `userRewardPerTokenPaid` mapping is updated via [AbstractRewarder._updateReward(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L124-L140) **before** a user receives vault shares. This can be done by moving the stake functionality from [LMPVault._afterTokenTransfer(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L854-L865)  to  [LMPVault._beforeTokenTransfer(...)](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L834-L852):
