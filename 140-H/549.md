# Steal TOKE reward by transfering `LMPVault` token to another address

## Summary

`LMPVault.sol` refresh both `to` and `from` address reward during token transfer.
But wrong order of execution cause wrong reward calculation.
This allow receiver of ERC4626 token to earn unfair reward using wrong token reward calculation.

By repeatedly transfering `LMPVault` token to new address, attacker can infinitely claim reward.

## Vulnerability Detail

When transfering LMPVault token, it suppose to refresh reward for both user.
But it refresh receiver user reward after receiving new token cause wrong reward calculation.

Here is execution order when transfering token.

- address A transfer `LMPVault` token to new address B that never claim reward or holding `LMPVault` token.
- `_beforeTokenTransfer()` called. A reward is updated and claimed.
- `LMPVault` token balance change. A balance reduce and increase B balance.
- `_afterTokenTransfer()` called. B reward is updated based on new token balance.
- Updating B reward suppose to do the following: refresh total earned reward and update lastTime user claim reward to current block.
- earned reward is based on current token balance. Because balance already change, so updating reward after token transfer cause wrong reward calculation.

## Impact

Malicious user can steal all reward from vault

## Code Snippet

```solidity
  function _updateReward(address account) internal {
      uint256 earnedRewards = 0;
      rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken();
      lastUpdateBlock = lastBlockRewardApplicable();

      if (account != address(0)) {
          earnedRewards = earned(account);//@ this suppose to return zero for account with no deposit or claim.
          rewards[account] = earnedRewards;
          userRewardPerTokenPaid[account] = rewardPerTokenStored;
      }

      emit UserRewardUpdated(account, earnedRewards, rewardPerTokenStored, lastUpdateBlock);
  }
  //@ earned() calculation based on current balance. So updating reward after token already transfer cause wrong reward calculation.
  function earned(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
      return (balanceOf(account) * (rewardPerToken() - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]) / 1e18) + rewards[account];
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Move updating reward from `_afterTokenTransfer()` to `_beforeTokenTransfer()`. Or include new function to refresh earned reward for specific user.

```js
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused {
    // Nothing to do really do here
    if (from == to) {
        return;
    }

    // If this isn't a mint of new tokens, then they are being transferred
    // from someone who is "staked" in the rewarder. Make sure they stop earning
    // When they transfer those funds
    if (from != address(0)) {
        rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
    }

    // Make sure the destination wallet total share balance doesn't go above the
    // current perWalletLimit
    if (balanceOf(to) + amount > perWalletLimit) {
        revert OverWalletLimit(to);
    }
    //@audit move from _afterTokenTransfer to _beforeTokenTransfer. Update to address before updating token balanceOf
    if (to != address(0)) {
        rewarder.stake(to, amount);//@ stake actually doing nothing except refresh reward and emit event. So this is not "staking" in traditional sense.
    }
}
```
