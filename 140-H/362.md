# Users can potentially get an unlimited amount of reward tokens from `LMPVault` and from  `DestinationVaults`
## Summary

Whenever a user receives vault tokens of `LMPVault` or of a `DestinationVault` (i.e. via minting  from depositting assets to the vault or via transferring the vault tokens to another user), they will instantly receive reward tokens which should not happen.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `LMPVault._afterTokenTransfer()` or `DestinationVault._afterTokenTransfer()` gets called, `MainRewarder.stake()` is being called (line 351 DestinationVault.sol, line 863 LMPVault.sol), which subsequently calls `AbstractRewarder._updateReward()` (line 87 MainRewarder.sol) and then `AbstractRewarder.earned()` (line 134 AbstractRewarder.sol)) to determine the earned rewards for the user and assign the value to `rewards[account]` (line 135 AbstractRewarder.sol).

Inside the `AbstractRewarder.earned()` method the new rewards are determined based on the balance of the user (`balanceOf(account)`). The `AbstractRewarder.balanceOf()` method returns the balance of the user in the vault (`stakeTracker.balanceOf(account)`,  line 156 AbstractRewarder.sol). At this moment the balance of the user in the vault is already the updated balance which includes the new tokens that were minted for the user or transferred to the user, since the call stack starts from `LMPVault._afterTokenTransfer()` or `DestinationVault._afterTokenTransfer()`. This means that the user will instantly receive reward tokens from the protocol directly after vault tokens from `LMPVault` or from a `DestinationVault` were minted or transferred to them, which should not happen.

`AbstractRewarder.earned()` returns the currently earned reward as described above and this value gets assigned to `rewards[account]` (line 135 AbstractRewarder.sol). If `AbstractRewarder.earned()` would then be called again for example to withdraw the rewards, the return value includes the accounted value from `rewards[account]` plus the new rewards (`balance * (rewardPerToken() - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account])`) that were realized meanwhile:

```solidity
// AbstractRewarder.earned()
205        return (balanceOf(account) * (rewardPerToken() - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]) / 1e18) + rewards[account];
```

#### Example:

- Alice never received any reward tokens from `LMPVault` or from a `DestinationVault`.
- Alice deposits into `LMPVault` the first time, immediately receiving reward tokens. Because `AbstractRewarder.earned()` gets called subsequently from `LMPVault._afterTokenTransfer()`, and there `userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]` will be equal to 0, since it is the first time that Alice deposits into `LMPVault`. This means that Alice instantly receives the full amount of reward tokens calculated from `AbstractRewarder.earned()` based on her balance of vault tokens AFTER she depositted.
- Alice transfers her `LMPVault` tokens to Bob, which triggers `LMPVault._afterTokenTransfer()` for Bob so that Bob will instantly receive reward tokens based on their new balance AFTER Alice sent them their `LMPVault` tokens. Bob also never received reward tokens before so that they now also receive a lot of reward tokens from their `LMPVault` tokens that were transferred to them.
- This can be repeated by transferring the vault tokens to other wallets so that reward tokens are being generated again and again to create a potentially unlimited amount of reward tokens, by abusing this issue.

In the same way as described above, a potentially unlimited amount of reward tokens from the `DesinationVaults` can be gotten, since the destination vaults suffer from the same issue.

## Impact

By abusing this issue a user can potentially receive an unlimited amount of reward tokens from the `LMPVault` and from the `DestinationVaults`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider calling `MainRewarder.getReward(to, true)` inside `LMPVault._beforeTokenTransfer()` and `DestinationVault._beforeTokenTransfer()` in order to make sure that `userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]` (line 136 AbstractRewarder.sol) gets updated so that the user will not receive rewards for the new vault tokens that are being minted or transferred to them.
