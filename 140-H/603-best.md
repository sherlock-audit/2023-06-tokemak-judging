# Immediately start getting rewards belonging to others after staking
## Summary

Malicious users could abuse the accounting error to immediately start getting rewards belonging to others after staking, leading to a loss of reward tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

> **Note**
> This issue affects both LMPVault and DV since they use the same underlying reward contract.

Assume a new user called Bob mints 100 LMPVault or DV shares. The ERC20's `_mint` function will be called, which will first increase Bob's balance at Line 267 and then trigger the `_afterTokenTransfer` hook at Line 271.

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/0457042d93d9dfd760dbaa06a4d2f1216fdbe297/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L259

```solidity
File: ERC20.sol
259:     function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
..SNIP..
262:         _beforeTokenTransfer(address(0), account, amount);
263: 
264:         _totalSupply += amount;
265:         unchecked {
266:             // Overflow not possible: balance + amount is at most totalSupply + amount, which is checked above.
267:             _balances[account] += amount;
268:         }
..SNIP..
271:         _afterTokenTransfer(address(0), account, amount);
272:     }
```

The `_afterTokenTransfer` hook will automatically stake the newly minted shares to the rewarder contracts on behalf of Bob.

```solidity
File: LMPVault.sol
854:     function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
..SNIP..
862:         if (to != address(0)) {
863:             rewarder.stake(to, amount);
864:         }
865:     }
```

Within the `MainRewarder.stake` function, it will first call the `_updateReward` function at Line 87 to take a snapshot of accumulated rewards. Since Bob is a new user, his accumulated rewards should be zero. However, this turned out to be false due to the bug described in this report.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L86

```solidity
File: MainRewarder.sol
86:     function stake(address account, uint256 amount) public onlyStakeTracker {
87:         _updateReward(account);
88:         _stake(account, amount);
89: 
90:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < extraRewards.length; ++i) {
91:             IExtraRewarder(extraRewards[i]).stake(account, amount);
92:         }
93:     }
```

When the `_updateReward` function is executed, it will compute Bob's earned rewards.  It is important to note that at this point, Bob's balance has already been updated to 100 shares in the `stakeTracker` contract, and `userRewardPerTokenPaid[Bob]` is zero.

Bob's earned reward will be as follows, where $r$ is the `rewardPerToken()`:

$$
earned(Bob) = 100\ {shares \times (r - 0)} = 100r
$$

Bob immediately accumulated a reward of $100r$ upon staking into the rewarder contract, which is incorrect. Bob could withdraw $100r$ reward tokens that do not belong to him.

```solidity
File: AbstractRewarder.sol
128:     function _updateReward(address account) internal {
129:         uint256 earnedRewards = 0;
130:         rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken();
131:         lastUpdateBlock = lastBlockRewardApplicable();
132: 
133:         if (account != address(0)) {
134:             earnedRewards = earned(account);
135:             rewards[account] = earnedRewards;
136:             userRewardPerTokenPaid[account] = rewardPerTokenStored;
137:         }
138: 
139:         emit UserRewardUpdated(account, earnedRewards, rewardPerTokenStored, lastUpdateBlock);
140:     }
..SNIP..
155:     function balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
156:         return stakeTracker.balanceOf(account);
157:     }
..SNIP..
204:     function earned(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
205:         return (balanceOf(account) * (rewardPerToken() - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]) / 1e18) + rewards[account];
206:     }
```

## Impact

Loss of reward tokens for the vault shareholders.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the balance of the users in the rewarder contract is only incremented after the `_updateReward` function is executed.

One option is to track the balance of the staker and total supply internally within the rewarder contract and avoid reading the states in the `stakeTracker` contract, commonly seen in many reward contracts.

```diff
File: AbstractRewarder.sol
function balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
-   return stakeTracker.balanceOf(account);
+	return _balances[account];
}
```

```diff
File: AbstractRewarder.sol
function _stake(address account, uint256 amount) internal {
    Errors.verifyNotZero(account, "account");
    Errors.verifyNotZero(amount, "amount");
    
+    _totalSupply += amount
+    _balances[account] += amount

    emit Staked(account, amount);
}
```
