# Unable to transfer LMPVault's LP tokens
## Summary

Users were unable to withdraw assets from LMPVault and unable to transfer LMPVault's LP tokens due to the revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the LMPVault LP tokens are transferred, the following `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook will be triggered. It will withdraw and claim the reward from LMPVault's Main Rewarder.

```solidity
File: LMPVault.sol
834:     function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused {
835:         // Nothing to do really do here
836:         if (from == to) {
837:             return;
838:         }
839: 
840:         // If this isn't a mint of new tokens, then they are being transferred
841:         // from someone who is "staked" in the rewarder. Make sure they stop earning
842:         // When they transfer those funds
843:         if (from != address(0)) {
844:             rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
845:         }
```

Assume that the account earned a small amount of TOKE reward tokens (less than `GPToken.MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT`/10000). After the TOKE reward tokens are claimed, they will be staked to the `GPToke` contract at Line 375 below. However, since the amount of TOKE rewards is smaller than the minimal staking amount, the TX will revert. As a result, the transfer of the LMPvault LP token will fail.

```solidity
File: AbstractRewarder.sol
354:     function _getReward(address account) internal {
..SNIP..
363:         rewards[account] = 0;
364:         emit RewardPaid(account, reward);
365: 
366:         // if NOT toke, or staking is turned off (by duration = 0), just send reward back
367:         if (rewardToken != tokeAddress || tokeLockDuration == 0) {
368:             IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(account, reward);
369:         } else {
370:             // authorize gpToke to get our reward Toke
371:             // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
372:             IERC20(address(tokeAddress)).approve(address(gpToke), reward);
373: 
374:             // stake Toke
375:             gpToke.stake(reward, tokeLockDuration, account);
376:         }
377:     }
```

## Impact

Users were unable to withdraw assets from the LMPVault due to the revert. When withdrawing shares from a vault, the shares will be burned, which will also execute the [`_beforeTokenTransfer(account, address(0), amount)`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/0457042d93d9dfd760dbaa06a4d2f1216fdbe297/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L288) hook that triggers the bug.

The transfer function is the core contract functionality of any Token. A token contract without the capability to properly transfer balance would be rendered useless and must be redeployed with the bug fixed. If the LMPVault LP tokens are deployed on external third-party protocols such as in a DEX pool or used as collateral in a lending protocol, those external protocols will be affected. Users also have issues sending the LP Tokens from one account to another.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The best solution is to transfer the TOKE reward tokens directly to the account and incentivize them to stake the TOKE tokens themselves instead of staking the TOKE reward tokens on behalf of the users.

Note that removing the `MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT` from the `GPToke` token contract is not a solution to this issue as it will end up being DOSed by a large number of dust stakes.
