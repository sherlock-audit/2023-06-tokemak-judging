# Users are not able to withdraw their funds from `LMPVault`
## Summary

Users need to stake their TOKE rewards in `GPToke.sol`. 
However, `GPToke.sol` has a `MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT` which is a constant      
```solidity
uint256 public constant MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT = 10_000;
```
so users should earn at least `10_000` to avoid [this revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L103)  

## Vulnerability Detail

This will happen when the user withdraws his funds from the `LMPVault` 
But if this Vault has a hard time with no reward or just dust, for a period of time. Also the `claimsVaultRewards()` wouldn't be called when there is only say $50 worth of rewards to collect, gas would eat all the profits. Same with `liquidateVaultsForToken`. So the reward will be too small 

The `MainRewarder.sol`  will be forced by `GPToke.sol` to revert with `StakingAmountInsufficient()` error.

## Impact

- The user is not able to withdraw his funds. They are locked until the reward of the user reaches the `MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT`

## Recommendation

in `AbstractRewarder._getReward()` add check if the TOKE reward is small than `MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT` skip the stake action
