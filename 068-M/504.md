# A previously removed ````LMPVault```` can never been added to ````LMPVaultRegistry```` again
## Summary
The ````removeVault()```` function of  ````LMPVaultRegistry```` contract is missing to remove ````vaultAddress```` from ````_vaultsByType```` mapping, attempting to add a previously removed ````LMPVault```` would always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
Please look at the implementation of ````removeVault()````, ````vaultAddress```` is removed from ````_vaultsByAsset```` mapping, but not removed from ````_vaultsByType```` mapping. Hence,  ````addVault()```` with any previously removed ````vaultAddress```` would revert on L59.

File: src\vault\LMPVaultRegistry.sol
46:     function addVault(address vaultAddress) external onlyUpdater {
47:         Errors.verifyNotZero(vaultAddress, "vaultAddress");
48: 
49:         ILMPVault vault = ILMPVault(vaultAddress);
50: 
51:         address asset = vault.asset();
52:         bytes32 vaultType = vault.vaultType();
53: 
54:         if (!_vaults.add(vaultAddress)) revert VaultAlreadyExists(vaultAddress);
55:         //slither-disable-next-line unused-return
56:         if (!_assets.contains(asset)) _assets.add(asset);
57: 
58:         if (!_vaultsByAsset[asset].add(vaultAddress)) revert VaultAlreadyExists(vaultAddress);
59:         if (!_vaultsByType[vaultType].add(vaultAddress)) revert VaultAlreadyExists(vaultAddress);
60: 
61:         emit VaultAdded(asset, vaultAddress);
62:     }
63: 
64:     function removeVault(address vaultAddress) external onlyUpdater {
65:         Errors.verifyNotZero(vaultAddress, "vaultAddress");
66: 
67:         // remove from vaults list
68:         if (!_vaults.remove(vaultAddress)) revert VaultNotFound(vaultAddress);
69: 
70:         address asset = ILMPVault(vaultAddress).asset();
71: 
72:         // remove from assets list if this was the last vault for that asset
73:         if (_vaultsByAsset[asset].length() == 1) {
74:             //slither-disable-next-line unused-return
75:             _assets.remove(asset);
76:         }
77: 
78:         // remove from vaultsByAsset mapping
79:         if (!_vaultsByAsset[asset].remove(vaultAddress)) revert VaultNotFound(vaultAddress);
80: 
81:         emit VaultRemoved(asset, vaultAddress);
82:     }


```



## Impact
Any previously removed ````LMPVaults```` can never been added to ````LMPVaultRegistry```` again

## Recommendation
Removing ````LMPVault```` from ````_vaultsByType```` mapping when ````removeVault()````.
