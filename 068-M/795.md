# Cannot add vault if it has been removed previously from the LMPVaultRegistry
## Summary

Vaults are not removed from the vaultsByType set when they are rmoved from the LMPVault registry preventing them from being added to the registry again.

## Vulnerability Detail

A vault cannot be added to the registry if it has been removed before due to the check in the `addVault` function that reverts if the vaultAddress is in the vaultByType becuase the vault address is not removed from vaultByType in `removeVault`.

The onlyLMP modifier of DestinationVault uses the LMPVaultRegistry to check if an LMPVault is registered. Removing the vault from the registry prevents priveleged interation with the destination vault's functions `withdrawUnderlying` and `depositUnderlying`. These functions are used when rebalancing the vault. Not being able to call these functions would result in not being able to rebalance the LMPVault through the rebalance functionality.

## Impact

LMPVaults that were once removed but should be added are not able to rebalance.
