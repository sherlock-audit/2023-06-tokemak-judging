# Removed vault cannot be added again
## Summary
The removed vault cannot be added again because the addVault function will revert

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the fact that once a vault has been removed, attempts to re-add it using the addVault function fail and cause the function to revert. This behavior arises because the addVault function doesn't properly account for the scenario in which a vault has been removed previously

By looking at the removeVault() function, we can see that this function doesn't remove the vault from _vaultsByType. This means that the vault will still be present in that mapping. If you would like to re-add a vault that has already been removed, the addVault() function will revert due to this line of code:
```solidity
59:     if (!_vaultsByType[vaultType].add(vaultAddress)) revert VaultAlreadyExists(vaultAddress);
```

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that a previously removed vault cannot be re-added to the system. Any attempts to re-add it using the addVault function fail and cause the function to revert. This could  result in a loss of functionality or disruption to the normal operation of the smart contract. 

Also, the listVaultsForType function will return incorrect values, potentially leading to integration problems, as projects aiming to integrate with Tokemak may receive inaccurate information
