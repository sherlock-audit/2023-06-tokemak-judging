# M - Vault doesn't get removed from _vaultsByType, thus it can never be added again
## Summary
The `removeVault` function inside `LMPVaultRegistry` is encharged of removing a given vault address from the different lists and mappings. The other function from the pair is `addVault`, which in turn adds a given vault as long as it is not already there in the lists. There is an issue in `removeFunction` which makes it impossible for a removed vault to be added again.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `removeVault` forgets to remove the vault address from the set `_vaultsByType[vaultType]`. Therefore, if one tries to add a previously removed vault back to the registry, it will fail in the following code inside `addVault`:

```
if (!_vaultsByType[vaultType].add(vaultAddress)) revert VaultAlreadyExists(vaultAddress);
```

## Impact
Vaults that were previously removed can never again be added to the registry.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the vault address removal from the `_vaultsByType[vaultType]` set.
