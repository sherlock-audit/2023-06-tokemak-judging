# `LMPVaultRegistry` removed vaults cannot be added again since `_vaultsByType` mapping is not cleared
## Summary

`LMPVaultRegistry` removed vaults cannot be added again since `_vaultsByType` mapping is not cleared

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `addVault` in `LMPRegistry.sol` is used to add vaults and `removeVault` is used to remove them. The `addvault` function updates the following enumerable sets: `_vaults`, `_vaultsByAsset` and `_vaultsByType`. The add function expects the vault being added to not be in these sets, or it will revert based on the return value.

```solidity
if (!_vaults.add(vaultAddress)) revert VaultAlreadyExists(vaultAddress);
if (!_vaultsByAsset[asset].add(vaultAddress)) revert VaultAlreadyExists(vaultAddress);
if (!_vaultsByType[vaultType].add(vaultAddress)) revert VaultAlreadyExists(vaultAddress);
```

The issue is that the `removeVault` function does not update the `_vaultsByType` set. So when a vault is removed, the `_vaultsByType[vaultType]` set still contains the old vault address. So if the same vault is attempted to be added again, the `addVault` function will revert, since the `_vaultsByType[vaultType].add(vaultAddress)` function will return false.

## Impact

Once removed vaults cannot be added back. This can lead to loss of funds if the vault is removed by mistake, or for re-configuration purposes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Clear the vault from the `_vaultsByType` set when a vault is removed.

```solidity
if (!_vaultsByType[vaultType].remove(vaultAddress)) revert VaultNotFound(vaultAddress);
```
