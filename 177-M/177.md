# The getReward function of the ExtraRewarder contract has no access control
## Summary

The [getReward function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/ExtraRewarder.sol#L53) of the ExtraRewarder contract provides a user with the ability to update and receive rewards through the internal [_updateReward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L128) and [_getReward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L354) functions. However, unlike the similar [getReward function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L101-L103) implemented by the MainRewarder contract, this implementation of the function lacks access control, so any user can invoke this function for any account. This will allow for malicious users to manipulate the reward accounts of others. Specifically, when the contract has the `tokeAddress` defined as the `rewardToken` and the `tokeLockDuration` has a non-zero value users can [stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L372-L375) the rewards of others without the account owner's permission.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [getReward function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/ExtraRewarder.sol#L53) of the ExtraRewarder contract lacks access control, so any one can invoke this function for any account. 

## Impact

The lack of access control will allow for malicious users to manipulate the reward accounts of others and potentially allow for users to [stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L372-L375) the accounts of others, locking the funds for a period of time without permission.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Refactor the [getReward function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/ExtraRewarder.sol#L53) with access control. A possible way of doing this would be to refactor the function as shown below:
```solidity
    function getReward(address account) public nonReentrant {
        // @audit recommended mitigation
        if (msg.sender != address(stakeTracker) && msg.sender != account) {
            revert Errors.AccessDenied();
        }
        _updateReward(account);
        _getReward(account);
    }
```
