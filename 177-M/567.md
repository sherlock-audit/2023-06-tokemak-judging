# `ExtraRewarder.getReward` lack of access control
## Summary

Malicious can front-runs the reward claim by calling the permissionless `ExtraRewarder.getReward` function before Tokemak, resulting in a loss of reward tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ExtraRewarder.getReward` was found to lack access control. As a result, anyone can trigger a reward claim on behalf of someone else, and the reward tokens will be sent to the account address, potentially resulting in undesirable consequences.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/ExtraRewarder.sol#L53

```solidity
File: ExtraRewarder.sol
53:     function getReward(address account) public nonReentrant {
54:         _updateReward(account);
55:         _getReward(account);
56:     }
```

One example is that if the destination vaults support extra reward tokens, it will result in a loss of reward tokens due to the use of the before and after balances to determine the amount of rewards it receives.

Assume a malicious user front-runs the reward claim by calling the `ExtraRewarder.getReward` function before Tokemak. When Tokemak triggers the `ExtraRewarder.getReward` function, it will return zero reward tokens at Line 773 below. As a result, the before and after balances will be the same, and `claimedRewardValue` will be zero.

```solidity
File: LMPVault.sol
752:     function _updateDebtReporting(address[] memory _destinations) private {
..SNIP..
759:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < nDest; ++i) {
760:             IDestinationVault destVault = IDestinationVault(_destinations[i]);
761: 
762:             if (!destinations.contains(address(destVault))) {
763:                 revert InvalidDestination(address(destVault));
764:             }
765: 
766:             // Get the reward value we've earned. DV rewards are always in terms of base asset
767:             // We track the gas used purely for off-chain stats purposes
768:             // Main rewarder on DV's store the earned and liquidated rewards
769:             // Extra rewarders are disabled at the DV level
770:             uint256 claimGasUsed = gasleft();
771:             uint256 beforeBaseAsset = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
772:             // We don't want any extras, those would likely not be baseAsset
773:             IMainRewarder(destVault.rewarder()).getReward(address(this), false);
774:             uint256 claimedRewardValue = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - beforeBaseAsset;
775:             claimGasUsed -= gasleft();
776:             idleIncrease += claimedRewardValue;
```

## Impact

Loss of reward tokens that belong to the users and protocols.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the `mainRewardOnly` modifier to ensure that only the MainRewarder can call it.

```diff
File: ExtraRewarder.sol
- function getReward(address account) public nonReentrant {
+ function getReward(address account) public nonReentrant mainRewardOnly {
    _updateReward(account);
    _getReward(account);
}
```
