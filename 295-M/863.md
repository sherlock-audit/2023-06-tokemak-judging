# Tellor oracle can be manipulated
## Summary
Tellor oracle can be manipulated

## Vulnerability Detail
I will briefly explain some Tellor security designs.

Tellor bases his security design in an exponential cost to dispute. They have a several-round voting to dispute a single value but we are interested in the Cost of Stalling (CoS) the System.

To stale the system we need to dipute every single value for a given period, for a given asset.

According to whitepaper cost starts at baseFee and increase with the following formula

𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑒𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑑,𝑡,𝑟>1 = 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑒𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑖 × 2 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑅𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑑,𝑡−1

Where

𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑒𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑖 is the initial dispute fee (baseFee)

𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑅𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑑 is the number of disputes open for a specific ID

Tellor team has similar values in different docs around internet.

​However, this is nice if we always assume that one data is sent every block (an ideal system).

And here is where the real nightmare comes. Current frequency for data in Tellor is very low, that you are reading data once an hour or less!!.

This design was thought considering that these chains are faster so if you data is sent every block then breaking the system would be prohibitively expensive. Again, security depends on the frequency of data. But, this is not the case.

An attacker can consistently `dispute` tellor's` oracle price for hours without being super costly due to the fact that the data is read very seldomly.

## Impact
By not tipping your tellor feed an attacker can manipulate it depending on  how often the data is updated

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the Tellor tip mechanism

Tellor whitepaper:

“Parties who wish to build reporter support for their query should follow best practices when selecting data for their query (publish data specification on github, promote/ educate in the community), but will also need to tip a higher amount to incentivize activity”

​This means that in order to use data safely you need to pay to be sure that frequency is secure taking into account the impact of the volatility and the time to dispute.
