# Tellor's Default dispute time is 30 minutes which will lead to stale data being accepted
## Summary
Tellor's Default dispute time is 30 minutes which will lead to stale data being accepted
## Vulnerability Detail

To explain this issue I will first compare Chainlink to Tellor.

In Chainlink, there are triggers of 0,5% for BTC and ETH and 1% for other assets. This is to ensure that you are cutting error by those values.

Tellor, on the other hand, is an optimistic oracle. Stakers use the oracle system to put data on chain submitValue(..) that are directly shown in the oracle. The security lies the fact that data consumers should wait some dispute windows in order to give time to others to dispute data and remove incorrect or malicious data.

This is what happened in a Liquity bug found last year, they were reading instant data.

After being solved by the following analysis/article: https://www.liquity.org/blog/tellor-issue-and-fix

Tokemak is currently using 30 minutes dispute time. However, in Liquity they are using 15 minutes for ETH because there has been made an analysis of ETH volatility behaviour.

```solidity
 (bytes memory value, uint256 timestampRetrieved) = getDataBefore(tellorInfo.queryId, timestamp - 30 minutes);
```

Basically there is a tradeoff between the volatility of an asset and the dispute time. More time is safer to have time to dipute but more likely to read a so old value. Less dispute time you have less error but no time to dispute can put you at risk of reading a manipulated value.

In your case, you are using way too much dispute time 30min, double the recommended, which will for sure bring staleness to the price data.
If your tellor integration is also intended to work with erc20s, not just ETH, then the dispute time should be even less than 15 minutes because of the volatility of those assets.  The gap between the optimal value and yours is too wide and will lead to stale data being accepted.

## Impact
Stale data will be accepted

## Recommendation
If your tellor integration is also intended to work with erc20s, not just ETH, then the dispute time should be even less than 15 minutes because of the volatility of those assets.
