# The delay period of 30 minutes is too long for Tellor
## Summary

Disputing fake prices is permissionless and mostly profitable, so there is an economic incentive to dispute a fake price. Anyone interested in the correct functioning of Liquity can also monitor price reports and submit disputes. The process is easy to automate and it only takes one dispute per fake price to remove it.

## Vulnerability Detail

The delay period of 30 minutes is too long
There is a tradeoff between the volatility of an asset and the dispute time
A longer delay gives disputers more of a time buffer to dispute a fake price report. However, a shorter delay leads to a smaller differential between the price the system sees and the real market price.

## Impact

- The protocol is exposed to use outdated prices from The Tellor, this will lead every vault using it as a source of info to lose funds due to wrong computation 

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/TellorOracle.sol#L105

```solidity
File: TellorOracle.sol
101:     function getPriceInEth(address tokenToPrice) external returns (uint256) {
102:         TellorInfo memory tellorInfo = _getQueryInfo(tokenToPrice);
103:         uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
104:         // Giving time for Tellor network to dispute price
105:         (bytes memory value, uint256 timestampRetrieved) = getDataBefore(tellorInfo.queryId, timestamp - 30 minutes);

```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The Tellor dev team suggests it to be 15 mins

But Tellor docs say 20 mins
https://docs.tellor.io/tellor/getting-data/solidity-integration#reading-data

Also, The Liquity protocol set the delay period to 15 minutes
