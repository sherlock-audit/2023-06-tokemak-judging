# Yield or user loss due to outdated price from Tellor oracle
## Summary
`TellorOracle` uses a fixed 30 minute time window when calling `getDataBefore()`, leading to outdated prices for volatile assets, causing yield or user loss in the `LMPVault`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Tellor oracle works by staking TRB tokens when commiting a price to the network. If this price is wrong, it can be disputed and the staker is slashed. For this reason, it's unsafe to get the most updated price, as it can be manipulated by attackers at a very low cost. For this reason, a time window of 30 minutes was chosen, to increase the chances that a malicious price got disputed. 

However, not all assets have the same volatility, such that choosing a time window of 30 minutes for all of them will lead to significant price deviations. Even for the ETH-USD pair, Liquity chose [15 minutes](https://www.liquity.org/blog/tellor-issue-and-fix). Therefore, a suitable time window should be chosen and tweaked if needed for each token.

Added a test to `LMPVault-Withdraw.t.sol`, showing that the `LMPVault` withdraws more than it should due to the price from the oracle being less than the actual swap price:
```solidity
function test_POC_OutdatedPrice_YieldLoss() public {
    _accessController.grantRole(Roles.SOLVER_ROLE, address(this));
    _accessController.grantRole(Roles.LMP_FEE_SETTER_ROLE, address(this));

    // User is going to deposit 1000 asset
    _asset.mint(address(this), 1000);
    _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);
    _lmpVault.deposit(1000, address(this));

    // Deployed 1000 asset to DV1
    _underlyerOne.mint(address(this), 500);
    _underlyerOne.approve(address(_lmpVault), 500);
    _lmpVault.rebalance(
        address(_destVaultOne),
        address(_underlyerOne), // tokenIn
        500,
        address(0), // destinationOut, none when sending out baseAsset
        address(_asset), // baseAsset, tokenOut
        1000
    );

    _lmpVault.redeem(500, address(this), address(this));

    assertEq(_lmpVault.totalSupply(), 500);
    assertEq(_lmpVault.totalDebt(), 500);
    assertEq(_lmpVault.totalIdle(), 50);
}
...
contract TestDestinationVault is DestinationVault {
    ...
    function _burnUnderlyer(uint256 underlyerAmount)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        returns (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts)
    {
        ...
        uint256 amount = (underlyerAmount * underlyingPrice) / assetPrice * 11 / 10; // actual price is 10% bigger
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```
If the swap price was lower than the oracle price, the user would take a loss. Not placing the full test again here, but instead of specifying `amount*11/10` in `TestDestinationVault:_burnUnderlyer()`, put `amount*9/10`. It will pull 10% less assets to the user.

## Impact
Reduced long term yield and/or user losses (which could be very significant, depending on the volatility of the pair). The yield loss comes from the fact that if the reported outdated price is lower than the real one, extra assets will be withdrawn from destination vaults, not earning full yield. The user loss stems from the fact that if the price is higher than the real one, the shares (and debt) burned will lead to less than expected assets pulled.

## Code Snippet
Tellor oracle fixed [30 minutes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/TellorOracle.sol#L105) time window.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The oracle prices should be as fresh as possible, while being sufficient secure. As the freshness of the price depends essentially on the volatily of an asset, create a mapping in `TellorOracle` storing the time window for each token address.
