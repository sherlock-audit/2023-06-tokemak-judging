# Malicious / delayed tellor price feed data can be consumed before it get disputed and removed
## Summary
Malicious / delayed tellor price feed data can be consumed before it get disputed and removed

## Vulnerability Detail

the tellor oracle [consumes oracle data](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/oracles/providers/TellorOracle.sol#L105) from oracle

by default the data feed is always delayed by 30 minutes

```solidity
 // Giving time for Tellor network to dispute price
        (bytes memory value, uint256 timestampRetrieved) = getDataBefore(tellorInfo.queryId, timestamp - 30 minutes);
```

but it is that within the 30 minutes window the malicious price does not get disputed

Oracles in the tellor network can be malicious, this means that the oracle will be reporting incorrect data. The oracle will then be disputed and after removed. The problem is that while the oracle is being disputed, tokemak will still be accepting prices from the malicious oracle.

```solidity
 function _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
        DestinationInfo storage destInfo,
        IDestinationVault destVault,
        uint256 userShares,
        uint256 maxAssetsToPull,
        uint256 totalVaultShares
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) {
        // Figure out how many shares we can burn from the destination as well
        // as what our totalDebt deduction should be (totalDebt being a cached value).
        // If the destination vault is currently sitting at a profit, then the user can burn
        // all the shares this vault owns. If its at a loss, they can only burn an amount
        // proportional to their ownership of this vault. This is so a user doesn't lock in
        // a loss for the entire vault during their withdrawal

        uint256 currentDvShares = destVault.balanceOf(address(this));

        // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
        if (currentDvShares == 0) {
            return (0, 0);
        }

        // Calculate the current value of our shares
        uint256 currentDvDebtValue = destVault.debtValue(currentDvShares);
```
in the above snippet there is a call to a function that calls an oracle and tellor is one of these oracles that will provide a value.
the call is in this specific line of code `uint256 currentDvDebtValue = destVault.debtValue(currentDvShares)`
`debtValue` function is being called let us take a look at this function below
```solidity
    function _debtValue(uint256 shares) private returns (uint256 value) {
        //slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
        if (shares == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 price = _systemRegistry.rootPriceOracle().getPriceInEth(_underlying);

        // At the moment we are only supporting WETH baseAsset
        // We know its 1:1 to ETH so we'll just return the current value
        return (price * shares) / (10 ** _underlyingDecimals);
    }
```
when assigning price we have a call to `_systemRegistry.rootPriceOracle().getPriceInEth(_underlying)`
this takes in the value from tellor.

Now let us think back to the beginning of this report.
> Oracles in the tellor network can be malicious, this means that the oracle will be reporting incorrect data. The oracle will then be disputed and after removed. The problem is that while the oracle is being disputed, tokemak will still be accepting prices from the malicious oracle.

Now that we understand the possibility of a tellor oracle being malicious and reporting incorrect data. 

we can now determine there is a situation where `_debtValue` is called and reports incorrect data. This data can either be overvalued or undervalued, each outcome will be a bad impact to the protocol.

when the debt value is incorrect this will cause a domino effect. 
Because `_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn` relies on the return value of `_debtValue` and this value can be incorrect because of a malicious tellor oracle which has not been removed, the user shares may be miscalculated and the users debt value will be inflated. This will cause the user's assets to be burned at the incorrect rate.
this is a complete loss of funds for the user.

Below is a report that further explains this similar issue
https://github.com/liquity/dev/security/advisories/GHSA-5x6p-646h-mmgj

Similar to liqudity, the tokenmak is designed to consume the fresh price, not the price feed delayed by 30 minuntes

and the 30 minutes dispute window does not ensure the malicious price feed get disputed and removed

when malicious price feed is consumed and calculated the debt value, removing the price feed is too late

## Impact
Because a malicious tellor oracle can return an incorrect oracle price to `_debtValue`, this will lead to a user burning shares at an incorrect rate and cause a loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend adding a derivation check which checks the value of an oracle with 1-2 other oracles. if the value is not correct, use the other two sane oracles.
