# Withdrawal will fail when a Destination Vault Insures  a loss
## Summary
WIthdral will revert when one or more destination vault are in loss due to the check in LMPVault.withdrwal method that checks that the withdrwan assets equal the amount worth of shares being burnt.

## Vulnerability Detail
The reason for this lies in the fact that the function makes a call to LMPVault._withdraw which makes a call to ```LMPDebt._calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn```  which computes the actual amount to be burnt. Where the problem lies is the fact that ```LMPDebt._calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn``` during a loss, can only burn an amount proportional to their ownership of this vault, this implies that contrary to what LPMVault thinks will be burnt, less will be burnt during a loss and less asset will be pulled in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L483
If this event happens in multiple destination vault, it will affect the total possible withdrwal and consequently the total asset transfered to the user at the end which will triger the revert in the withdraw function if not equal to the perceived shares worth in the LMPVault.

## Let Examine a scenario
1. Alice deposit 1000 WETH to get 1000 shares of the LMP Vault.
2. The value was deployed into various vault based of expected APR
3. Alice decides to withdraw, so her shares was computed to worth 1000WETH 
4. The withdrawal method then makes a call to get her shares burnt in various vault, but in a particular destination where over 50% of her asset was deployed was in a loss and her value dropped by 10WETH
5. Since https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L509 assumes all amount has been pulled without checkinig, transfer was made in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L535
6. But the whole transaction revert in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L416-L417 because 990WETH is less than the value of her shares according to the LMPVault. 

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
LMPVault should be updated in case of shares/value readjusment of any vault so it can update shares accordingly.
