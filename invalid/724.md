# `FrxBeaconChainBacking.currentRatio` is not trusted for reporting LSD tokens staked at some timestamp
## Summary

In `FrxBeaconChainBacking` , `currentRatio` claims that ratio give the up to date  information about LSD tokens staked in beacon chain but it is incorrect


## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File:  src/beacon/FrxBeaconChainBacking.sol

    function update(
        uint208 totalAssets,
        uint208 totalLiabilities,
        uint48 queriedTimestamp
    ) public hasRole(Roles.LSD_BACKING_UPDATER) {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(totalAssets, "totalAssets");
        Errors.verifyNotZero(totalLiabilities, "totalLiabilities");
      //@audit-issue here add equal sign too otherwise last time will be updatable
        if (queriedTimestamp < currentRatio.timestamp) {
            revert Errors.InvalidParam("queriedTimestamp");
        }
        uint208 ratio = totalAssets * decimalPad / totalLiabilities;
        currentRatio = Ratio(ratio, queriedTimestamp);

        emit RatioUpdated(ratio, totalAssets, totalLiabilities, queriedTimestamp);
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IBeaconChainBacking
    function current() external view returns (uint208 ratio, uint48 queriedTimestamp) {
        ratio = currentRatio.ratio;
        queriedTimestamp = currentRatio.timestamp;
    }

`update()` function update the ratio info till last block not at the queried time. Currently mining one block is taking average 13 second so this ratio always be valid for last block not a queried time.

FLOW

Suppose LSD_BACKING_UPDATER calls the `update()` function to update the ratio [tx-1 ]and within the same block someone deposited the LSD tokens[tx-2 i.e tx-2 is after tx -1 in the block] so right now `currentRatio` won't be giving correct ratio of staked tokens in Beacon chain.

This can't be claim that currentRatio is true at queriedTime leading to breaking further calculation based on this ratio.

## Impact

incorrect LSD staked in beacon chain 

## Code Snippet

see above

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Protocol shouldn't trust  `currentratio` for LSD tokens staked in beacon chain . this will be only reliable for last blocks not at current queriedTime
