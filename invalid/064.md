# Potential DOS due to out of gas in `BalancerLPComposableStableEthOracle` Contract
## Summary
The `BalancerLPComposableStableEthOracle` contract is designed to serve as a price oracle for Balancer Composable Stable pools. However, a potential issue arises due to excessive gas consumption in the `getPriceInEth` function. The function's loop that iterates over the tokens held in the pool may lead to high gas costs, potentially resulting in out-of-gas errors and DoS attacks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the for loop that iterates over all tokens in the pool. If the pool contains a large number of tokens or tokens with high gas cost for their `getPriceInEth` function, the loop could consume excessive gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit.
```solidity
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < nTokens;) {
            if (i != bptIndex) {
                // Our prices are always in 1e18
                uint256 tokenPrice = systemRegistry.rootPriceOracle().getPriceInEth(address(tokens[i]));
                tokenPrice = tokenPrice * 1e18 / pool.getTokenRate(tokens[i]);
                if (tokenPrice < minPrice) {
                    minPrice = tokenPrice;
                }
            }

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```
## Impact
Transactions interacting with the contract may fail with out-of-gas errors, disrupting the normal functioning of the contract and related applications.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a limit on the number of tokens a pool can contain to prevent pools with an excessive number of tokens.
