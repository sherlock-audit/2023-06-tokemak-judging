# Read-only re-entrancy checks can be disabled
## Summary

If the read-only re-entrancy check is not enforced, malicious users can inflate the value of their LMPVault shares to allow them to withdraw more assets than expected, leading to a loss for other vault users.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `registerPool` function of `CurveV1StableEthOracle` and `CurveV2CryptoEthOracle` gives the option to disable the re-entrancy check for Curve. However, if a Curve pool support Native ETH, the re-entrancy check must always be enabled to prevent any potential manipulation.

```solidity
File: CurveV1StableEthOracle.sol
59:     /// @param checkReentrancy whether or not we should check for read-only reentrancy
60:     function registerPool(address curvePool, address curveLpToken, bool checkReentrancy) external onlyOwner {
..SNIP..
87:         lpTokenToPool[lpToken] = PoolData({ pool: curvePool, checkReentrancy: checkReentrancy ? 1 : 0 ..SNIP..
```

```solidity

107:     function registerPool(address curvePool, address curveLpToken, bool checkReentrancy) external onlyOwner {
..SNIP..
120:         // Only need ability to check for read-only reentrancy for pools containing native Eth.
121:         if (checkReentrancy) {
122:             if (tokens[0] != ETH && tokens[1] != ETH) revert MustHaveEthForReentrancy();
123:         }
124: 
125:         /**
126:          * Curve V2 pools always price second token in `coins` array in first token in `coins` array.  This means that
127:          *    if `coins[0]` is Weth, and `coins[1]` is rEth, the price will be rEth as base and weth as quote.  Hence
128:          *    to get lp price we will always want to use the second token in the array, priced in eth.
129:          */
130:         lpTokenToPool[lpToken] =
131:             PoolData({ pool: curvePool, checkReentrancy: checkReentrancy ? 1 : 0, tokenToPrice: tokens[1] });
..SNIP..
```

## Impact

The price of the LP tokens reported by the Curve oracles will be manipulated if the read-only re-entrancy check is not enforced, leading malicious users to inflate the value of their LMPVault shares to allow them to withdraw more assets than expected, leading to a loss for other vault users.

Also, the protocol will be vulnerable to read-only re-entrancy attacks, as seen in many of the past attacks if it is not enforced.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Read-only re-entrancy check should not be allowed to be disabled under any circumstance if the Curve Pool support native ETH. Consider removing the option to disable the check.
