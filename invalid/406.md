# Lack of reward balance checks can make some users unable to withdraw their rewards
## Summary
The primary concern is the possibility of announcing rewards without ensuring that the tokens are indeed present in the contract. This discrepancy could lead to a situation where users might be unable to claim their rightfully earned rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

It is more or less the same as detected for [velodrome](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/186).
The function `notifyRewardAmount` updates the rewards without checking if the contract has enough balance to cover these rewards. Under normal circumstances, since users can not withdraw all their rewards in time, the balance in the contract contains rewards that belong to the users but have not been withdrawn yet. This means, currently there are no checks to make sure the contract has enough amount of rewardToken.

## Proof of Concept

1. Alice stakes 1,000 Tokens
2.  a whitelisted account sends 100 reward tokens to the contract;
3. The same whitelisted account calls queueNewRewards with an amount of 100 which in-turn calls notifyRewardAmount() with amount = 100
4. Alice checks her earned rewards `earned(address account)` after the duration has passed and notices she's earned 100 tokens, but she decides not to claim them yet (so, no call to `getRewards(...)`.
5. Without sending additional tokens to the contract, the whitelisted account calls `queueNewRewards` again with an amount of 100. The function transfers another 100 reward tokens from the whitelisted account to the contract, but due to the previous unclaimed rewards and the current state of the contract, the function may again call `notifyRewardAmount`, setting a new reward rate and essentially promising another 100 tokens as rewards. The transaction will succeed.
6. Some time later, Alice decides to check her rewards (calls `earned(address accout)`) and notices she's now entitled to 200 tokens.
7. Alice tries to claim her rewards by calling `getRewards(...)`. She expects to receive 200 tokens, but the contract might only have 100 tokens left, causing a discrepancy. The transaction will fail due to insufficient balance of rewardToken

## Impact

This discrepancy could lead to a situation where users might be unable to claim their rightfully earned rewards. Users could be under the impression that they've earned rewards which, when they try to claim, might not be available.

## Recommendation

Consider changing the function notifyRewardAmount to use safeTansferFrom to transfer rewardToken into the contract.

```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 reward) internal {
        _updateReward(address(0));
        historicalRewards += reward;


        if (block.number < periodInBlockFinish) {
            uint256 remaining = periodInBlockFinish - block.number;
            // slither-disable-next-line divide-before-multiply
            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            reward += leftover;
        }


        rewardRate = reward / durationInBlock;
        rewardToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), reward);
        currentRewards = reward;
        lastUpdateBlock = block.number;
        periodInBlockFinish = block.number + durationInBlock;


        emit RewardAdded(reward, rewardRate, lastUpdateBlock, periodInBlockFinish, historicalRewards);
    }

```
