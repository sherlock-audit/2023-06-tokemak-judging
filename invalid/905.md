# flashRebalance only check tokenInBalance diff instead of manually transferring tokens
## Summary

Flashloans only check the balance diff of token, rather than manually transferring tokens.
Attackers can steal vault funds by depositing tokens via Vault's deposit / mint method to disguise flashloan repayments.

## Vulnerability Detail

The following is the code of `LMPVault.flashRebalance`, which is a library function called by `LMPVault.flashRebalance`.
LMPVault is also an ERC4626 vault, which means that attackers can deposit tokens in the vault to disguise flashloan repayment, thereby stealing the rebalance funds.
 
```solidity
            // get "before" counts
            uint256 tokenInBalanceBefore = IERC20(params.tokenIn).balanceOf(address(this));

            // Give control back to the solver so they can make use of the "out" assets
            // and get our "in" asset
            bytes32 flashResult = receiver.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, params.tokenIn, params.amountIn, 0, data);

            // We assume the solver will send us the assets
            uint256 tokenInBalanceAfter = IERC20(params.tokenIn).balanceOf(address(this));

            // Make sure the call was successful and verify we have at least the assets we think
            // we were getting
            // @audit Only check the token balance diff, rather than manually transferring tokens
            if (
                flashResult != keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan")
                    || tokenInBalanceAfter < tokenInBalanceBefore + params.amountIn
            ) {
                revert Errors.FlashLoanFailed(params.tokenIn, params.amountIn);
            }
```

## Impact

Attackers can steal vault funds by depositing tokens via Vault's deposit / mint method to disguise flashloan repayments.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Manually transfer funds from the receiver to this contract instead of just checking the token balance.
