# Critical Vulnerability in Convex CVX Minting Function
## Summary

The Convex CVX minting function contains an exploit that allows an attacker to rapidly mint a large portion of the total supply by manipulating variables. This could undermine the token distribution and economics.

## Vulnerability Detail

The exploit involves:

- Using the cliff system to double mint rewards each interval as supply decreases
- Draining the total supply by repeatedly calling the function
- Acquiring CRV rewards and multiplying by high cliff bonus
- No limit on minting above max supply

## Impact

An attacker could:

- Quickly mint over 50% of total supply from low starting supply
- Significantly profit by dumping the newly minted tokens
- Devalue existing CVX tokens and undermine project growth

```solidity
    function getCVXMintAmount(address cvxToken, uint256 crvEarned) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 cvxSupply = IERC20(cvxToken).totalSupply();


        // if no cvx has been minted, pre-mine the same amount as the provided crv
        if (cvxSupply == 0) {
            return crvEarned;
        }


        // determine the current cliff
        uint256 currentCliff = cvxSupply / CLIFF_SIZE;


        // if the current cliff is below the max, then CVX will be minted
        if (currentCliff < CLIFF_COUNT) {
            uint256 remainingCliffs = CLIFF_COUNT - currentCliff;
            uint256 cvxEarned = crvEarned * remainingCliffs / CLIFF_COUNT;


            // ensure that the max supply has not been exceeded
            uint256 amountUntilMax = CVX_MAX_SUPPLY - cvxSupply;
            if (cvxEarned > amountUntilMax) {
                // if maxSupply would be exceeded then return the remaining supply
                return amountUntilMax;
            }


            return cvxEarned;
        }


        return 0;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Use linear minting formula without cliffs
- Require supply > 0 to mint
- Enforce strict max supply cap
- Add governance time delay before minting
