# H - LMPVault suffers from the ERC4626 first depositor front-running issue
## Summary
There is a common vulnerability in ERC4626 implementations, whereby the first depositor can get front-runned and lose their deposit. The attacker front-runs and deposits first, and goes ahead and directly transfers tokens to the vault, with the goal of minting 0 shares for the front-runned depositor. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `deposit` function will convert the number of assets to shares using function `_convertToShares` with rounding down:

```
    function _convertToShares(uint256 assets, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();

        // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
        shares = (assets == 0 || supply == 0) ? assets : assets.mulDiv(supply, totalAssets(), rounding);
    }
```

Because the calculation is dependent upon the current token supply, this value can be manipulated by an attacker who in a first depositor will
1. establish the price of a share (typically it sets it as 1wei)
2. transfer a big amount of tokens directly

## Impact
The first vault depositor can lose the entire deposit.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One way to avoid this is by minting virtual shares. See https://blog.openzeppelin.com/a-novel-defense-against-erc4626-inflation-attacks
