# Stale Price Handling Gap in RootPriceOracle contract
## Summary
The contract responsible for managing token-Oracle mappings lacks a robust mechanism to handle stale prices from the Oracle. This deficiency exposes the system to inaccurate asset valuations, potential arbitrage opportunities, market manipulation risks, and user losses due to outdated price information.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the absence of checks for stale prices in the contract's functions. Let's examine the `getPriceInEth` function, which retrieves the price of a token in terms of Ether (ETH):
```solidity
// @dev This and all price oracles are not view fn's so that we can perform the Curve reentrancy check
    /// @inheritdoc IRootPriceOracle
    function getPriceInEth(address token) external returns (uint256 price) {//TODO: We're getting price in eth from an oracle
        // Skip the token address(0) check and just rely on the oracle lookup
        // Emit token so we can figure out what was actually 0 later
        IPriceOracle oracle = tokenMappings[token];
        if (address(0) == address(oracle)) {
            revert MissingTokenOracle(token);
        }

        price = oracle.getPriceInEth(token);
    }
}
```
The function obtains the Oracle for the given token from the `tokenMappings` mapping and then fetches the price in Ether using the Oracle's `getPriceInEth` function. However, the code does not include any checks to verify the freshness of the price data returned by the Oracle. This oversight allows stale or outdated prices to be used directly in the system.
## Impact
Users relying on this price information might make ill-informed decisions, leading to losses or missed opportunities. Inaccurate pricing can also cause market manipulations, disruption of trading strategies, and destabilization of the DeFi ecosystem.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In this updated version, `MAX_TIMESTAMP_DIFF` defines the maximum allowable time difference between the current block's timestamp and the Oracle's price timestamp. `MIN_VALID_PRICE` and `MAX_VALID_PRICE` set the acceptable range for valid prices. If the timestamp is too old or the price falls outside the valid range, the function reverts, preventing the use of stale or inaccurate prices.
```solidity
function getPriceInEth(address token) external returns (uint256 price) {
    IPriceOracle oracle = tokenMappings[token];
    if (address(0) == address(oracle)) {
        revert MissingTokenOracle(token);
    }

    uint256 timestamp = oracle.getPriceTimestamp(token);
    require(block.timestamp - timestamp <= MAX_TIMESTAMP_DIFF, "Stale Price");

    price = oracle.getPriceInEth(token);
    require(price >= MIN_VALID_PRICE && price <= MAX_VALID_PRICE, "Invalid Price");
}
```
