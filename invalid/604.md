# Price returned by Oracle is not verified
## Summary

The price returned by the oracle is not adequately verified, leading to incorrect pricing being accepted.

## Vulnerability Detail

As per the [example](https://github.com/tellor-io/tellor-caller-liquity/blob/3ed91e4b15f0bac737f2966e36805ade3daf8162/contracts/TellorCaller.sol#L51C34-L51C34) provided by Tellor on how to integrate the Tellor oracle into the system, it has shown the need to check that the price returned by the oracle is not zero.

https://github.com/tellor-io/tellor-caller-liquity/blob/3ed91e4b15f0bac737f2966e36805ade3daf8162/contracts/TellorCaller.sol#L51C34-L51C34

```solidity
function getTellorCurrentValue(bytes32 _queryId)
	..SNIP..
    // retrieve most recent 20+ minute old value for a queryId. the time buffer allows time for a bad value to be disputed
    (, bytes memory data, uint256 timestamp) = tellor.getDataBefore(_queryId, block.timestamp - 20 minutes);
    uint256 _value = abi.decode(data, (uint256));
    if (timestamp == 0 || _value == 0) return (false, _value, timestamp);
```

Thus, the value returned from the `getDataBefore` function should be verified to ensure that the price returned by the oracle is not zero. However, this was not implemented.

```solidity
File: TellorOracle.sol
101:     function getPriceInEth(address tokenToPrice) external returns (uint256) {
102:         TellorInfo memory tellorInfo = _getQueryInfo(tokenToPrice);
103:         uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
104:         // Giving time for Tellor network to dispute price
105:         (bytes memory value, uint256 timestampRetrieved) = getDataBefore(tellorInfo.queryId, timestamp - 30 minutes);
106:         uint256 tellorStoredTimeout = uint256(tellorInfo.pricingTimeout);
107:         uint256 tokenPricingTimeout = tellorStoredTimeout == 0 ? DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT : tellorStoredTimeout;
108: 
109:         // Check that something was returned and freshness of price.
110:         if (timestampRetrieved == 0 || timestamp - timestampRetrieved > tokenPricingTimeout) {
111:             revert InvalidDataReturned();
112:         }
113: 
114:         uint256 price = abi.decode(value, (uint256));
115:         return _denominationPricing(tellorInfo.denomination, price, tokenToPrice);
116:     }
```

## Impact

The protocol relies on the oracle to provide accurate pricing for many critical operations, such as determining the debt values of DV, calculators/stats used during the rebalancing process, NAV/shares of the LMPVault, and determining how much assets the users should receive during withdrawal.

If an incorrect value of zero is returned from Tellor, affected assets within the protocol will be considered worthless.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the affected function as follows.

```diff
function getPriceInEth(address tokenToPrice) external returns (uint256) {
    TellorInfo memory tellorInfo = _getQueryInfo(tokenToPrice);
    uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
    // Giving time for Tellor network to dispute price
    (bytes memory value, uint256 timestampRetrieved) = getDataBefore(tellorInfo.queryId, timestamp - 30 minutes);
    uint256 tellorStoredTimeout = uint256(tellorInfo.pricingTimeout);
    uint256 tokenPricingTimeout = tellorStoredTimeout == 0 ? DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT : tellorStoredTimeout;

    // Check that something was returned and freshness of price.
-   if (timestampRetrieved == 0 || timestamp - timestampRetrieved > tokenPricingTimeout) {
+	if (timestampRetrieved == 0 || value == 0 || timestamp - timestampRetrieved > tokenPricingTimeout) {
        revert InvalidDataReturned();
    }

    uint256 price = abi.decode(value, (uint256));
    return _denominationPricing(tellorInfo.denomination, price, tokenToPrice);
}
```
