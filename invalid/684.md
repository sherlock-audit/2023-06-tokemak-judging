# [M-1] No check if base asset = WETH before using _processWethOut()
## Summary
In LMPVaultRouterBase contract, Both Redeem() and withdraw() functions have a parameter unwrapWETH to send the value as ETH if it is true. But this doesn't check if the base asset of the vault is actually WETH, before doing the unwrapping, and funds expected `to` address receive zero funds

## Vulnerability Detail
In both the withdraw() function and redeem() function, If the unwrapWETH flag is true, then the tokens are transferred to the routerBase contract, and is unwrapped and transferred as ETH to the 'to' address

But there is no check if the base asset of the vault is actually `WETH`
## Impact
If the base asset is not `WETH`, and the function is called with the unwrapWETH as `True` then the respective tokens will be transferred to the router contract and not to the expected `to` address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A check to be done if vault.asset() == WETH, before setting the destination address in both redeem() and withdraw() functions
