# Incorrect Usage of safeApprove
## Summary

`safeApprove` has been deprecated

Using `safeApprove` is unsafe as when `swapRouter` does not consume all the allowance for some reason, the future call to `SafeERC20.safeApprove()` will revert, because `safeApprove` will check and revert if the current allowance is not `0`.


## Vulnerability Detail

### When:

1. Alice initiates a transaction that triggers the use of the `safeApprove` function.
2. The contract's internal logic involves interactions with external services like `swapRouter` using the deprecated `safeApprove` approach.
3. In the course of execution, the external service not use all the allowances.
4. Subsequent transactions involving the same token suffer from failed `safeApprove` attempts, leading to disruptions and potential user fund lockup.

### Result:

The misuse of `safeApprove` interfaces within the contract can lead to unintended behavior, including the disruption of key functions and temporary inaccessibility of user funds. This can result in an overall degraded user experience and potential financial losses due to the inability to execute critical transactions.

## Impact

The issue at hand pertains to the incorrect implementation of the `safeApprove` function within the smart contract. This could potentially lead to the disruption of essential contract functions and even result in the freezing of user funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, it is strongly advised to replace the deprecated `safeApprove` method with safer authorization patterns such as `approve` and `transferFrom`. These methods provide more control over authorization and prevent potential situations where user funds could be inadvertently locked up due to improper usage of allowances. Staying updated with the latest security practices and consulting resources such as the OpenZeppelin documentation can help ensure robust contract design and the security of user funds.
