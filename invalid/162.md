# Incorrect branching logic in a function _collectRewards()
## Summary
If the user calls the function collectRewards() twice in a row, he will receive his rewards 2 times.

## Vulnerability Detail

First time user will receive their netRewards in the thread if (distribute) { in line
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L292
and then this netRewards will be added to unclaimedRewards in line 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L309

## Impact
The staking contract may pay out more rewards to users than intended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add else branch:
```solidity
if (distribute) {
            //
            // if asked for actual distribution, transfer all earnings
            //

            // reset sandboxed rewards
            unclaimedRewards[user] = 0;

            // get total amount by adding new rewards and previously sandboxed
            uint256 totalClaiming = netRewards + pendingRewards;

            // update running totals
            totalRewardsClaimed += totalClaiming;
            rewardsClaimed[user] += totalClaiming;

            emit RewardsClaimed(user, totalClaiming);

            // send rewards to user
            weth.safeTransfer(user, totalClaiming);

            // return total amount claimed
            return totalClaiming;
        }
else{
        if (netRewards > 0) {
            // Save (sandbox) to their account for later transfer
            unclaimedRewards[user] += netRewards;

            emit RewardsCollected(user, netRewards);
        }
}
```
