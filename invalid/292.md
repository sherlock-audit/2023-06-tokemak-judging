# First depositor can steal funds from the vault
## Summary
First depositor can steal funds from the vault

## Vulnerability Detail

A hacker back-runs the transaction of the LMPVault creation.
The hacker mints for themself one share: deposit(1). Thus, totalAssets()==1, totalSupply()==1.
The hacker front-runs the deposit of the victim who wants to deposit 20,000 USDT (20,000.000000).
The hacker inflates the denominator right in front of the victim: asset.transfer(20_000e6). Now totalAssets()==20_000e6 + 1, totalSupply()==1.
Next, the victim's tx takes place. The victim gets 1 * 20_000e6 / (20_000e6 + 1) == 0 shares. The victim gets zero shares.
The hacker burns their share and gets all the money.

```solidity
       _baseAsset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets); 

        totalIdle += assets;

        _mint(receiver, shares);

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);

```

## Impact
Loss of funds for the user depositing after the first depositor

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 One option is to restrict the minting of zero shares, but this alone doesn't fully address the vulnerability, better to us OZ virtual shares
