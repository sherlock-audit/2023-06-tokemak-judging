# netReward is counted twice in GPToken.sol token collect reward accounting
## Summary

user can repeated claim more WETH reward then he should be 

## Vulnerability Detail

netReward is counted twice in GPToken.sol token accounting

if we take a look at the function _collectRewards in GPToken.sol

when the distribute flag set to true when collecting reward

```solidity
    function collectRewards() external returns (uint256) {
        return _collectRewards(msg.sender, true);
    }
```

the pending reward is [read from the state](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L273)

```solidity
 uint256 pendingRewards = unclaimedRewards[user];
```

the user claimed reward is [netReward + pendingReward](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L292C14-L292C14)

```solidity
// get total amount by adding new rewards and previously sandboxed
uint256 totalClaiming = netRewards + pendingRewards;

// update running totals
totalRewardsClaimed += totalClaiming;
rewardsClaimed[user] += totalClaiming;

emit RewardsClaimed(user, totalClaiming);

// send rewards to user
weth.safeTransfer(user, totalClaiming);
```

the netRewards is already distributed to user but when the distribution flag set to true,

the netRewards is incorrectedly [count towards the pending reward again](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L307)

```solidity
if (netRewards > 0) {
	// Save (sandbox) to their account for later transfer
	unclaimedRewards[user] += netRewards;

	emit RewardsCollected(user, netRewards);
}
```

the user can call collectReward and then call collectReward to get more reward then he should and draining the fund

## Impact

User claim too much reward and can call collectReward within single transaction to drain the WETH reward

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

change to

```solidity
	if (netRewards > 0 && distribution == false) {
		// Save (sandbox) to their account for later transfer
		unclaimedRewards[user] += netRewards;

		emit RewardsCollected(user, netRewards);
	}
```

only when not distrubting we accure the netRwards, otherwise distribute the netRewards direclty to user
