# Absence of explicit address verification for `convexStaking` can enable system-wide exploits by rogue staking contracts
## Summary

The `CurveConvexDestinationVault` contract is predicated on the `convexStaking` address for its core functionalities. Unfortunately, there isn’t any explicit verification for the legitimacy of this address during the contract initialization, leading to possible pitfalls. **An attacker that has enough knowledge about the underlying structure of the protocol can set a rogue staking contract**, thus posing an existential threat to the entire protocol.

Though the below referenced `initialize` function provided for `DestinationVault` (**which currently is the key inherit point for the initialization in `CurveConvexDestinationVault`**) indeed checks for the non-zero address of several parameters but **nonetheless it still misses out on checking the `convexStaking` address**, leading to the scenario and the specific risks mentioned in the report.

**Contracts interacting with other contracts should always ensure that they're interacting with the expected, authentic contracts**. This is especially critical when the interactions involve token transfers, staking, and other sensitive operations.

## Vulnerability Detail

Within the `CurveConvexDestinationVault` contract, the `initialize` function merely takes the `convexStaking` address from its input parameters without verification of its authenticity. This design decision implies:

1. **Functions like `_onDeposit` call upon the `ConvexStaking.depositAndStake` using the staking contract**.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/CurveConvexDestinationVault.sol#L162-L164

2. **Similarly, `_ensureLocalUnderlyingBalance` invokes `ConvexStaking.withdrawStake`**.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/CurveConvexDestinationVault.sol#L167-L175

3. **The `_collectRewards` function directly retrieves rewards from the staking address**.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/CurveConvexDestinationVault.sol#L178-L180

The dangers of interacting with a malicious staking contract are vast and **could lead to token theft, unintended operations, or complete contract lockup**. For instance, a malicious contract can:

> #### **Manipulate Outputs:** It can return arbitrary reward figures, impacting reward distributions.
> #### **Denial of Service:** It can halt deposits or withdrawals.
> #### **False Feedback:** Since the main contract uses feedback from the staking operations, incorrect feedback can destabilize its internal states.

Additionally, **for a more extensive and parallel analysis of the entire underlying logic could be worth checking out this finding: #5**

## Impact

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can:

* **Steal assets:** They can use a malicious staking contract to extract tokens from the vault.
* **Price manipulation:** They can skew reward amounts or deposit values, affecting token valuations.
* **Reputation damage:** Even if not for direct financial gain, just demonstrating the exploit could tarnish the platform’s reputation.

## Code Snippet

Within `CurveConvexDestinationVault.sol`:

```solidity
function initialize(
...
convexStaking = initParams.convexStaking;
...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. **Whitelist approach**: One of the simplest ways to prevent rogue contracts from being set is to use a whitelist approach where only trusted contract addresses can be added. This whitelist could be managed by a multi-signature admin or governance process. 

2. **Contract interface validation**: If a whitelist approach is deemed too restrictive or centralized, you could also verify if the contract at the given address has specific methods or properties, which, although not bulletproof, can offer some level of assurance. However, it's relatively easy for a malicious actor to mimic method signatures. Hence, this should be considered as an additional check rather than a primary solution.

> Considering the above recommendations, let's provide a possible implementation for the whitelist approach:

```solidity
contract CurveConvexDestinationVault {
    
    // Mapping to keep track of whitelisted staking contracts
    mapping(address => bool) public whitelistedStakingContracts;

    // Only the admin can add or remove from the whitelist
    modifier onlyAdmin() {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Not authorized");
        _;
    }
    
    // Function to add an address to the whitelist
    function addToWhitelist(address _stakingContract) external onlyAdmin {
        whitelistedStakingContracts[_stakingContract] = true;
    }
    
    // Function to remove an address from the whitelist
    function removeFromWhitelist(address _stakingContract) external onlyAdmin {
        whitelistedStakingContracts[_stakingContract] = false;
    }

    /// @inheritdoc DestinationVault
    function initialize(
        IERC20 baseAsset_,
        IERC20 underlyer_,
        IMainRewarder rewarder_,
        address[] memory additionalTrackedTokens_,
        bytes memory params_
    ) public virtual override {
        // ... other initialization code ...

        InitParams memory initParams = abi.decode(params_, (InitParams));
        
        // Ensure the convexStaking address is whitelisted
        require(whitelistedStakingContracts[initParams.convexStaking], "Staking contract not whitelisted");
        
        convexStaking = initParams.convexStaking;

        // ... other initialization code ...
    }
}
```

This approach ensures that only staking contracts that have been whitelisted by the admin can be set during initialization. It provides a simple but effective layer of protection against the vulnerability highlighted in the report.

To provide a different approach that rather involves `SystemRegistry`, should also look at the recommendation mentioned in #5.

## POC

1. Deploy a malicious staking contract that mimics the real staking contract but has rogue functionalities embedded.
2. Initiate the `CurveConvexDestinationVault` contract using the address of this rogue contract.
3. Interact with the potentially compromised functions within `CurveConvexDestinationVault`.
4. Observe the malfeasance perpetuated by the rogue staking contract.

> **fakeStaking.sol**:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

contract fakeStaking {
    address public attacker;

    constructor(address _attacker) {
        attacker = _attacker;
    }

    function depositAndStake(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount, bool _stake) external returns (bool) {
        payable(attacker).transfer(_amount); 
        return false;
    }

    function withdrawStake(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount, bool _stake) external returns (bool) {
        payable(attacker).transfer(_amount); 
        return false;
    }
}
```

> **POC script**:

```javascript
const { ethers, waffle } = require("hardhat");
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("Exploit CurveConvexDestinationVault", function () {
    let vault, fakeStake, attacker;

    before(async function () {
        [attacker, ...rest] = await ethers.getSigners();

        const Vault = await ethers.getContractFactory("CurveConvexDestinationVault");
        vault = await Vault.deploy();
        const FakeStake = await ethers.getContractFactory("fakeStaking");
        fakeStake = await FakeStake.deploy(attacker.address);

        await vault.initialize();
    });

    it("Exploit the vault", async function () {
        const initialBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(attacker.address);

        await vault._onDeposit(ethers.utils.parseEther("1"));
        await vault._ensureLocalUnderlyingBalance(ethers.utils.parseEther("1"));
        await vault._collectRewards();

        const finalBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(attacker.address);
        expect(finalBalance).to.be.greaterThan(initialBalance); 
    });
});
```

This POC conclusively illustrates the inherent risks of integrating a rogue staking contract into the system. Proper validation techniques are essential to safeguard the protocol's integrity.
