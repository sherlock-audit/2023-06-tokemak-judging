# ```addLiquidity``` function will revert even after previous operations in the function have been executed
## Summary
When variables with reserved memory space don't get values assigned to them,  it could cause the function to deviate from the intended behavior. Missing variable assignments logic in the contract will result in consequent function call failures even after the execution of the previous operations in the functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
In ```BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol```, ```_addLiquidity``` function, [L103](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/destinations/adapters/BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol#L103), reserves memory for ```assetBalanceBefore``` of each token address passed into the pool but fails to assign them values. This automatically fills them with zero values. And this affects the next internal call at [L107](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/destinations/adapters/BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol#L107) - ```_ensureTokenOrderAndApprovals(...)```, and it's use at [L130](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/destinations/adapters/BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol#L130)'s ```if``` statement. If ```assetBalancesBefore```, holds zero values till the final checks, this will cause the function to always revert because subtracting any non-zero value from zero will cause an underflow and would revert because of the update on solidity since version 0.8.0 and above.

## Impact
Since solidity version 0.8.0 compiler update, calculations that result in values that underflows/overflows are more likely to revert because of the unsigned integer type (from 0 to 2**256 - 1). If a non-zero value is subtracted from a zero value, it gets underflowed, closer to the max value of unsigned integers on solidity. For example, ```0 - 20``` will return ```2**256 - 21``` which is a big number.

```addLiquidity``` function will revert even after the execution of previous operations in the function call. And this could cause future complications when balance checks don't match during ```removeLiquidity()``` function call. 
 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        _ensureTokenOrderAndApprovals(vault, exactTokenAmounts, tokens, poolId, assetBalancesBefore);

  ....

            if (currentBalance != assetBalancesBefore[i] - exactTokenAmounts[i]) {
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. ```_ensureTokenOrderAndApprovals()``` function should be made to return ```assetBalancesBefore``` values in [107](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/destinations/adapters/BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol#L107).
2. Redesign the logic in a way that will move the last "quality assurance" checks up before running ```vault.JoinPool(...)``` to avoid unmatched values, loss of money spent, and tons of reverts because the checks barely change anything after the previous operations have been executed..
