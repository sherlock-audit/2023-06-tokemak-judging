# The user's withdrawal request can get reverted
## Summary
When user send withdrawal transaction, `LMPVault.sol` need to check that how many shares we can burn from the `DestinationVault.sol`, this process get done in the in the `For` loop over all connected `DestinationVault's`. If an error occurs during this process, the user's withdrawal transaction will be rolled back in its entirety and users' funds can get stuck in the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the user sends a withdrawal request from the `LMPVault.sol`, the protocol must calculate how many tokens or shares in the connected `DestinationVault.sol` should be burned for shares provided by the user. this process get done in the in the `For` loop over all connected `DestinationVault's`.

In the `LMPDebt.sol` library and `_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn` function, current balance of `LMPVault.sol` in the `DestinationVault.sol` get saved as `currentDvShares`.

Next, the current share balance `currentDvShares` is compared with the amount of shares at the last debt reporting `cachedDvShares`, and if the current share balance is greater than the previous amount of shares, the transaction will get reverted.

A malicious user can transfer some of his/her balance in the `DestinationVault.sol` to `LMPVault.sol` address and cause the `currentDvShares` to exceed the `cachedDvShares`.

By doing this, the user's withdrawal transaction will get reverted and the user will not be able to withdraw funds from LMPVault.sol.

## Impact
The user's withdrawal transaction can get rolled back in its entirety and users' funds can get stuck in the vault.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If possible, add security check to the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function in `DestinationVault's`.
