# When the `perWalletLimit` is decreased, certain users will not be able to `withdraw` or `transfer`.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
`LMPVault` has a variable called `perWalletLimit` that limits the maximum balance per wallet.

This can be adjusted via `setPerWalletLimit`.

The comment in the code says `Any decrease in this value shouldn't affect what a wallet is already holding Just that their amount can't increase`.

However, if `setPerWalletLimit` is decreased, `_beforeTokenTransfer` checks `balanceOf(to) + amount > perWalletLimit`, so if the balance is greater than `perWalletLimit`, no `deposits`, `withdrawals`, or `transfers` can be made.

This could be fixed by increasing `setPerWalletLimit` again, but the team would not have realized that the decrease of `perWalletLimit` would prevent withdrawals and transfer. Even if you increased `setPerWalletLimit` after the fact, it would be difficult to tell users to withdraw or split to another wallet, and they might not see the notice. Therefore, temporarily increasing `setPerWalletLimit` is not a good solution. 

I think it's important to get the team's comments on this issue.

## Impact
When the perWalletLimit is decreased, certain users will not be able to withdraw or transfer.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check `perWalletLimit` only if `mint` in `_beforeTokenTransfer`.
