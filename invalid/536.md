# Chainlink oracle has circuit breakers returning prices that may be inaccurate
## Summary

The chainlink aggregator has a circuit breaker that returns the built-in minimum price and maximum price when the actual price is lower than the minimum price or higher than the maximum price, and there is a deviation from the actual price. Malicious users can use the price difference to arbitrage and steal funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. The token price has plummeted below the minimum price, but the oracle still considers the price to be the minimum price
2. Users acquire tokens from the market at a low price and are considered to have a higher value in the protocol
3. Users use the inflated value to steal the agreement's funds, leaving them with liabilities

## Impact

When the token price falls below the minimum price, the oracle will still return to the minimum price, resulting in funds that can be stolen

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When the token price falls below the minimum price, the oracle should stop working or use a backup oracle.
Minimum and maximum prices are available through `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer`.
