# Failure to Check `totalSupply()` in Reward Claiming
## Summary
The `_claimRewards` function in the provided code lacks proper checks on the `totalSupply()` of certain reward tokens, which can lead to erroneous calculations and reverts when attempting to claim rewards.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_claimRewards` function is responsible for claiming rewards for Convex staked LP tokens. It calculates the reward tokens to claim and their amounts, but it lacks checks on the `totalSupply()` before performing calculations involving this value. Specifically, the code calculates the `amountsClaimed` by subtracting `balancesBefore` from current `balances`. If the `totalSupply()` of any reward token is zero, this calculation will result in a negative value, causing reverts and erroneous claims.

Here's the relevant code snippet from the _claimRewards function:
```solidity
// ... (omitted for brevity) ...

// get balances after and calculate amounts claimed
for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalLength; ++i) {
    uint256 balance = 0;
    // Same check for "stash tokens"
    if (IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).totalSupply() > 0) {
        balance = IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).balanceOf(account);
    }

    amountsClaimed[i] = balance - balancesBefore[i];

    if (sendTo != address(this) && amountsClaimed[i] > 0) {
        IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(sendTo, amountsClaimed[i]);
    }
}

// ... (omitted for brevity) ...
```
## Impact
If the `totalSupply()` of any reward token is zero, the calculation `balance - balancesBefore` will result in negative values for `amountsClaimed`, leading to incorrect token transfers and potential reverts. This vulnerability can cause undesired token transfers, claim failures, and incorrect accounting of rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, add a conditional check on the `totalSupply()` of reward tokens before performing calculations that involve it. Only perform calculations when `totalSupply()` is greater than zero. Here's the suggested mitigation step for the vulnerable section:
```solidity
// ... (omitted for brevity) ...

// get balances after and calculate amounts claimed
for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalLength; ++i) {
    uint256 balance = 0;
    // Same check for "stash tokens"
    if (IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).totalSupply() > 0) {
        balance = IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).balanceOf(account);
        amountsClaimed[i] = balance > balancesBefore[i] ? balance - balancesBefore[i] : 0;

        if (sendTo != address(this) && amountsClaimed[i] > 0) {
            IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(sendTo, amountsClaimed[i]);
        }
    }
}

// ... (omitted for brevity) ...
```
By adding the conditional check, the code ensures that calculations are performed only when the `totalSupply()` is greater than zero, preventing negative values and potential reverts due to incorrect calculations.
