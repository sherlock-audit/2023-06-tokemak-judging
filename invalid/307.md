# If `if (info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull) {` is true, withdrawals and redeems will revert due to underflow
## Summary

If `if (info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull) {` is true, withdrawals and redeems will revert due to underflow

## Vulnerability Detail

When calling `redeem()` or `withdraw()` on the vault, it makes and internal call to `_withdraw()` which check that the amount to withdraw is more than what the vault actually has in idle to pull assets from destination vaults `uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));`

There is the case when you receive more than what it is needed to pull from the vault. Let's say 50 tokenA has to be pulled from the destination vault, but 51 tokenA is returned. If this happens, it will enter the following check:

```solidity
       if (info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull) {
        info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;
        info.totalAssetsPulled = info.totalAssetsToPull;
        break; 
        }
```
As you can see, it substracts the extra returned funds from the idle: `info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;` 

The problem is that this will always revert because `idleIncrease` on withdrawals and redeems is always 0. As you can see below

```solidity
  uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
                uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));
                info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled; 
```
` info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled; ` will always be 0. It takes the balance before. Let's say 20 tokenA as `assetPreBal` , then it takes the assetPulled which is 51 tokenA, and then adds the new balance, which is 20 + 51  tokenA = 71. And substracts the `assetPreBal` = 20 tokenA and also `assetPulled` which is 51 tokenA. Therefore, `info.idleIncrease` will always return 0 and if the scenario above described happens, withdrawals and redems will revert.

## Impact
Users will not be able to withdraw/redeem when `info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull`

## Recommendation
Handle the case where `info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull` in a different way so it does not revert due to underflow
