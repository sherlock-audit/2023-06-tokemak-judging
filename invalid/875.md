# Acceptance of 0 as a chainlink oracle timeout would lead to regular lock of price access or integration stale prices from multiple feeds being used


## Summary

Two sides to report:

- In a case where 0 is being set as the pricing timeOut in the chainlinkOracle.sol contract then the `DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT` in `BaseOracleDenominations.sol` value is used for timeOut, which is too low for multiple chainlink feeds and would lead to regular lengthy DOS while trying to query prices since the hardcoded timeout value, would consider any feed with a heartbeat of over 2 hours as potentially stale prices. contract will use the below
<details>
  <summary></summary>
```solidity
        if (
            roundId == 0 || price <= 0 || updatedAt == 0 || updatedAt > timestamp
                || updatedAt < timestamp - tokenPricingTimeout
        ) revert InvalidDataReturned();
```
</details>
So in a case where a feed has say 24 hour heartbeats and the price gets updates once in a day, after the first two hours, querying of prices is always reverted with `InvalidDataReturned`

- Current implementation of `BaseOracleDenominations.sol` contract would consider stale prices as not stale for some pools since `DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT` has being hardcoded to 2 hours, and since 2 hours is more than the heartbeat of quite a number of chainlink feeds this would mean integration of stale prices are accepted

NB: While for the first case, one could argue that it's a DOS and not a valid concern on sherlock, this easily leads to accumulation of bad debts in a case where a price query can't be achieved

## Vulnerability Detail

- In regards to the first part, Take a look at this section of [ChainlinkOracle.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/ChainlinkOracle.sol#L15)

```solidity
contract ChainlinkOracle is BaseOracleDenominations {
    /**
     * @notice Used to store info on token's Chainlink feed.
     * @param oracle Address of Chainlink oracle for token mapped.
     * @param pricingTimeout Custom timeout for asset pricing.  If 0, contract will use
     *      default defined in `BaseOracleDenominations.sol`.
```

- For second part of report, take a look at [BaseOracleDenominations.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/base/BaseOracleDenominations.sol#L22)

```solidity
    /// @notice Amount of time that can pass until a price is considered stale.
    //@
    uint256 public constant DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT = 2 hours;

```

Now, where as 2 hours is a good enough time for some feeds, this is not the case for feeds such as ETH/USD, why? The heartbeat of the chainlink ETH/USD feed is 60 minutes and it also includes a deviation threshold, i.e in a case where the prices does not move past the deviation threshold for a long time _an hour ish_, the price of the feed must get updated in those 60 minutes, that's 50% of present hardcoded time value. And if it doesn't get updated within this period, price should already be considered stale and there is no need to wait till 120 minutes passes before announcing it as stale

## Impact

- Regular DOS in a case where the last time price was updated is more than the `pricingTimeout`
- Inaccurate curb on integration of stale prices, i.e malicious users could act on system with ambiguous prices.

## Tool used

Manual Audit

## Recommendation

Never accept `0` and constantly set the `pricingTimeout` for each and every feed, taking into account their respective heartbeats.
