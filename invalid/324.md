# Rewards can be inflated
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function addWETHRewards(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(amount, "amount");

        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        Errors.verifyNotZero(supply, "supply");

        totalRewardsEarned += amount;
        accRewardPerShare += amount * REWARD_FACTOR / supply; 

        emit RewardsAdded(amount);

        weth.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```
When new rewards are added with addWETHRewards() function, the accRewardPerShare is calculated with the amount, reward factor and total supply.
```solidity
        // calculate user's new rewards per share (current minus claimed)
        uint256 netRewardsPerShare = accRewardPerShare - rewardDebtPerShare[user];
        // calculate amount of actual rewards
        uint256 netRewards = (balanceOf(user) * netRewardsPerShare) / REWARD_FACTOR;
```
And when the user uses the collectRewards() function, his net rewards are calculated with the users balance and accRewardPerShare.

The problem is, accRewardPerShare needs to be updated before the reward calculation because users can stake and inflate their balances and take more rewards than they should.

For example : 

[accRewardPerShare](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L235) is calculated with totalSupply == 1000.

The user stakes before calling the collectRewards() function.

Let's say [totalSupply](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L231) is equal to 1100 right now.

The user calls the collectRewards() function and his [balance(balanceOf(user)) is updated but accRewardPerShare is not updated with the current totalSupply(1100).](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L271) 

The user takes rewards more than they should.
## Impact
Users may take more rewards than they should.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
accRewardPerShare should be updated before calculating net rewards.
