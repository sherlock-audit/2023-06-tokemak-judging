# Double-charging fees on destination vault rewards during liquidation and rebalancing
## Summary

Destination vaults have various incentive rewards (e.g., LP staking) collected by the `LiquidationRow` contract and fees applied, reducing the distributable `MainRewarder` reward amount. Additionally, during `LMPVault` rebalancing, fees are charged again on the idle amount, which increased due to the withdrawn `MainRewarder` rewards. This results in overcharging fees and less profits for the users.

## Vulnerability Detail

Destination vault rewards (LP staking tokens, etc.) are [collected by the `LiquidationRow` contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L117), swapped to the base asset (i.e., WETH), and [distributed as `MainRewarder` rewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L277) to the respective destination vaults.

Protocol fees are charged and collected (if enabled) on the reward amount, and the remaining amount is queued as `MainRewarder` rewards in the various destination vaults.

```solidity
240: function _performLiquidation(
241:     uint256 gasBefore,
242:     address fromToken,
243:     address asyncSwapper,
244:     IDestinationVault[] memory vaultsToLiquidate,
245:     SwapParams memory params,
246:     uint256 totalBalanceToLiquidate,
247:     uint256[] memory vaultsBalances
248: ) private {
249:     uint256 length = vaultsToLiquidate.length;
250:     // the swapper checks that the amount received is greater or equal than the params.buyAmount
251:     uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);
252:
253:     // if the fee feature is turned on, send the fee to the fee receiver
254: @>  if (feeReceiver != address(0) && feeBps > 0) {
255: @>      uint256 fee = calculateFee(amountReceived);
256: @>      emit FeesTransfered(feeReceiver, amountReceived, fee);
257: @>
258: @>      // adjust the amount received after deducting the fee
259: @>      amountReceived -= fee;
260: @>      // transfer fee to the fee receiver
261: @>      IERC20(params.buyTokenAddress).safeTransfer(feeReceiver, fee);
262: @>  }
...      // [...]
```

Additionally, performance fees are charged and collected as well whenever the `LMPVault` vault is rebalanced via the `rebalance` and `flashRebalance` functions in [lines 703](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L703) and [727](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L727), respectively. As rebalancing out from a destination vault [calls the `DestinationVault.withdrawUnderlying` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L390), the associated `MainRewarder` rewards are withdrawn and [credited to the idle funds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L392) of the `LMPVault` vault as well.

Fees collected by the `_collectFees` function are calculated based on the current `idle` and `debt` amounts. As the `idle` amount has been increased by the withdrawn `MainRewarder` rewards during rebalancing, the fees are potentially overcharged, resulting in less profits for the users.

## Impact

Fees on destination vault rewards are potentially charged twice, once when the `LiquidationRow` contract collects the rewards and once when the rewards are withdrawn from the `LMPVault` vault while rebalancing. Resulting in overcharging fees and less profits for the users.

Fees are charged and collected on the realized destination vault rewards. The remaining amount is queued as `MainRewarder` rewards in the various destination vaults.

The `MainRewarder` rewards queued by the `LiquidationRow` contract are withdrawn as part of the rebasing functionality and credited to the `LMPVault` vault's idle funds. Fees are calculated based on the current `idle` and `debt` amounts, resulting in overcharging fees.

```solidity
800: function _collectFees(uint256 idle, uint256 debt, uint256 totalSupply) internal {

803:     uint256 shares = 0;
804:     uint256 profit = 0;
805:
806:     // If there's no supply then there should be no assets and so nothing
807:     // to actually take fees on

814:
815:     if (currentNavPerShare > effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) {
816:         // Even if we aren't going to take the fee (haven't set a sink)
817:         // We still want to calculate so we can emit for off-chain analysis
818:         profit = (currentNavPerShare - effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) * totalSupply;
819:         fees = profit.mulDiv(performanceFeeBps, (MAX_FEE_BPS ** 2), Math.Rounding.Up);
820:         if (fees > 0 && sink != address(0)) {
821:             // Calculated separate from other mints as normal share mint is round down
822:             shares = _convertToShares(fees, Math.Rounding.Up);
823:             _mint(sink, shares);
824:             emit Deposit(address(this), sink, fees, shares);
825:         }
826:         // Set our new high water mark, the last nav/share height we took fees
827:         navPerShareHighMark = currentNavPerShare;

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider not collecting fees on the liquidated rewards in `LiquidationRow` contract, as the fees get collected when rebalancing the `LMPVault` vault and its destination vaults.
