# Stake duration can be extended to infinity and most portion of the rewards can be claimed .
## Summary
The `extend` function in ` GPToke.sol` is used to extend  the duration of a lockup . Users will  extend their lockup time and mint extra points for their extended duration . 

However ,  `extend` function  doesnot check if the  extended duration exceeds the `maxduration` limit . 

This gives a malicious staker the ability to call  `extend` infinite times and mint  extra points everytime . As points are the measuring factor of how much reward a staker gets , the malicious user will get almost all of the rewards accumulated to the stakers . Other stakers will get close to nothing and the malicious staker will take almost the whole rewards . 

## Vulnerability Detail
See summary .

## Impact
Rewards getting stolen . 
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L158 
Here's the extend function : 
```solidity 
 function extend(uint256 lockupId, uint256 duration) external whenNotPaused {
        if (lockupId >= lockups[msg.sender].length) revert LockupDoesNotExist();

        // before doing anything, make sure the rewards checkpoints are updated!
        _collectRewards(msg.sender, false);

        // duration checked inside previewPoints
        Lockup storage lockup = lockups[msg.sender][lockupId];
        uint256 oldAmount = lockup.amount;
        uint256 oldEnd = lockup.end;
        uint256 oldPoints = lockup.points;

        (uint256 newPoints, uint256 newEnd) = previewPoints(oldAmount, duration); //@a if we call extend too many times then we will be able to mint large amount of points by staking the minimum amount  , and then take most of the reawards 

        if (newEnd <= oldEnd) revert ExtendDurationTooShort();
        lockup.end = uint128(newEnd);
        lockup.points = newPoints;
        lockups[msg.sender][lockupId] = lockup;
        // issue extra points for extension
        _mint(msg.sender, newPoints - oldPoints); 

        emit Extend(msg.sender, lockupId, oldAmount, oldEnd, newEnd, oldPoints, newPoints);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Tokens should be staked for a maximum of 4 years. 
While extending , Do not let a user extend for more than 4 years . Calculate the new ending time and revert if the lockup is extended for more than 4 years from current timestamp .
