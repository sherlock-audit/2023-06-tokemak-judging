# [M-03] `elapsedBlock` can lead to DoS and brick the `queueNewRewards` function
## Summary

The `elapsedBlock` can unexpectedly revert if `durationInBlock` is set to a higher value than `periodInBlockFinish`

## Vulnerability Detail

This vulnerability and the context for it are all inside the `AbstractRewarder` contract.

When `periodInBlockFinish` is higher than the current block number, the following else block is performed when `queueNewRewards` is called:

```solidity
           if (block.number >= periodInBlockFinish) {
            notifyRewardAmount(newRewards);
            queuedRewards = 0;
        } else {
            uint256 elapsedBlock = block.number - (periodInBlockFinish - durationInBlock);
            uint256 currentAtNow = rewardRate * elapsedBlock;
            uint256 queuedRatio = currentAtNow * 1000 / newRewards;
```
The `periodInBlockFinish` is set inside the `notifyRewardAmount` function:

```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 reward) internal {
         ...
        periodInBlockFinish = block.number + durationInBlock;
    }
```

However, the `durationInBlock` variable can be set to any number by a user with the `DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`:

```solidity
    function setDurationInBlock(uint256 _durationInBlock) external hasRole(Roles.DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        durationInBlock = _durationInBlock;
        emit RewardDurationUpdated(_durationInBlock);
    }
```

This could lead to a situation where `durationInBlock` is higher than `periodInBlockFinish` which will cause `queueNewRewards` to revert and be DoS-ed until the period has passed and the `if` block is performed inside `queueNewRewards`.

Let's look at the following scenario:

The initial `block.number = 10` and `durationInBlock = 40` for simplicity.
1. `notifyRewardAmount` is called and `periodInBlockFinish` is set to `block.number + durationInBlock = 50`.
2. Then a user with the `DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` calls `setDurationInBlock` and set `durationInBlock = 100`.
4. When `block.number = 25` a whitelisted user calls `queueNewRewards`.
5. The `if` block is skipped because `periodInBlockFinish` is still higher than `block.number` (50>25).
6. The `else` block will revert because of the following calculation `uint256 elapsedBlock = block.number - (periodInBlockFinish - durationInBlock);`

## Impact

This will lead to a DoS and the `queueNewRewards` function will be bricked until `block.number` is higher than `periodInBlockFinish`.

## Recommendation

Consider sanitizing the inputs for `setDurationInBlock` to avoid the following scenario. An example of that could be to put the below require statement:

```diff
    function setDurationInBlock(uint256 _durationInBlock) external hasRole(Roles.DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
+       require(block.number >= periodInBlockFinish, "error");
        durationInBlock = _durationInBlock;
        emit RewardDurationUpdated(_durationInBlock);
    }
```
