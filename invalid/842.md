# Attacker can steal rewards he isn't entitled to
## Summary
Attacker can earn rewards he isn't entitled to by sandwiching `notifyRewardAmount` transaction in Rewarder Contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
[`AbstractRewarder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol) is inherited by [`MainRewarder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol) and [`ExtraRewarder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/ExtraRewarder.sol)

The mainRewarder is associated with [`LMPVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L294) and [`DestinationVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L49)

Anytime a user is minted or burned shares of vault, mainRewarder's [`stake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L863) and [`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L844) is called and user gets associated rewards by it.

The reward received by user depends on the `rewardRate` which gets updated in the [`notifyRewardAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L285C9-L285C19)

[`AbstractRewarder.notifyRewardAmount#L274-L291`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L274-L291)
```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 reward) internal {
        _updateReward(address(0));
        historicalRewards += reward;


        if (block.number < periodInBlockFinish) {
            uint256 remaining = periodInBlockFinish - block.number;
            // slither-disable-next-line divide-before-multiply
            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            reward += leftover;
        }


        rewardRate = reward / durationInBlock;
        currentRewards = reward;
        lastUpdateBlock = block.number;
        periodInBlockFinish = block.number + durationInBlock;


        emit RewardAdded(reward, rewardRate, lastUpdateBlock, periodInBlockFinish, historicalRewards);
    }
```

`notifyRewardAmount` is called from `queueNewRewards()`. So, anytime `notifyRewardAmount` is supposed/meant to be called, attacker can use MEV and cause unfair division of rewards. 

1. Attacker mints large amount of vault shares so, `mainRewarder.stake` is called
2. Let the transaction calling `notifyRewardAmount` execute so, `rewardRate` is updated.
3. After some time, attacker redeems all his shares. So, `mainRewarder.withdraw` is called and then call [`mainRewarder.getReward()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L95) to get rewards.

## Impact
- Theft of unclaimed yield
- Attacker can get rewards he isn't entitled to

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We are not sure about the best mitigation here, but here is one possible way we can think of:

- Implementing some kind of locking period for which, users atleast need to lock their tokens
