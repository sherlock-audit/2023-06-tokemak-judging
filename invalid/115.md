# Read-Only Reetrancy
## Summary

The read-only reentrancy is a reentrancy scenario where a view the function is reentered, which in most cases is unguarded as it does not modify the contract's state. However, if the state is inconsistent, wrong values could be reported.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability is related to the use of external calls within the getPriceInEth function. 
```solidity 
uint256 virtualPrice = pool.getRate(); 
``` 
Specifically, the line involves an external call to the pool contract's getRate() function, which could potentially lead to a read-only reentrancy attack

## Impact

A read-only reentrancy attack, while not directly modifying the contract's state, can still have several significant impacts on a smart contract and its users:

* Depletion of Gas: Repeated read-only reentrancy calls can consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to higher transaction costs for users and making the contract unusable or expensive to interact with.

* Service Disruption: If the repeated external calls consume a large amount of gas, it can lead to network congestion and disrupt the normal operation of the Ethereum network, affecting other contracts and users.

* Inaccurate Data: The repeated reentrancy calls may result in inaccurate or manipulated data being read from external contracts, which could impact the decisions and actions of users relying on that data.

* Front-Running: Malicious actors could exploit the repeated external calls to front-run certain actions on the contract, attempting to gain an unfair advantage by acting before legitimate transactions are processed.

* Blocked Funds: If an attacker targets a contract that holds funds, they could attempt to repeatedly drain small amounts of funds through reentrancy attacks, depleting the contract's balance over time.

* Resource Exhaustion: Repeated external calls might consume computing resources and processing time, potentially leading to contract malfunction or resource exhaustion.

* Degraded Performance: Even if the contract's state is not modified, the repeated external calls could still slow down the contract's execution, leading to degraded performance and responsiveness.

* Complexity and Debugging: Identifying and mitigating read-only reentrancy vulnerabilities can be challenging, requiring complex code analysis and potentially introducing additional code complexity to defend against such attacks.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

* Use Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern: As mentioned earlier, reorder the code to follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. This ensures that all checks and calculations are performed before any external calls are made.

* Local Variable Storage: Store the results of external calls in local variables before performing calculations based on that data. This reduces the chances of unexpected behavior due to reentrancy.

* Limit External Calls: Minimize the number of external calls made within the function. Each external call introduces a potential attack vector. Only make external calls when absolutely necessary and ensure they are well-protected.

* Gas Limit and Estimations: Consider setting a gas limit for the external calls and estimate their gas consumption. This can help prevent excessive gas usage and mitigate congestion.

* Reentrancy Guards: Implement reentrancy guards at the function level or contract level. These guards prevent reentrancy attacks by blocking multiple calls from the same address before the first call completes.

Here is a piece of code that would be corrected against read-only reetrancy:
```solidity
function getPriceInEth(address token) external returns (uint256 price) {
    // Perform initial checks and calculations
    Errors.verifyNotZero(token, "token");

    IBalancerMetaStablePool pool = IBalancerMetaStablePool(token);
    bytes32 poolId = pool.getPoolId();

    (IERC20[] memory tokens,,) = balancerVault.getPoolTokens(poolId);

    if (tokens.length != 2) {
        revert InvalidTokenCount(token, tokens.length);
    }

    uint256 px0 = systemRegistry.rootPriceOracle().getPriceInEth(address(tokens[0]));
    uint256 px1 = systemRegistry.rootPriceOracle().getPriceInEth(address(tokens[1]));

    // Store external call results in local variables
    IRateProvider[] memory rateProviders = pool.getRateProviders();

    // Calculate other intermediate values...

    // Calculate virtualPrice...

    // Perform external calls only when necessary
    if (address(rateProviders[0]) != address(0)) {
        px0 = px0 * 1e18 / rateProviders[0].getRate();
    }

    if (address(rateProviders[1]) != address(0)) {
        px1 = px1 * 1e18 / rateProviders[1].getRate();
    }

    // Calculate virtualPrice...

    price = ((px0 > px1 ? px1 : px0) * virtualPrice) / 1e18;
}

```
