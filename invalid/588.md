# frxETH is loosely pegged to ETH
## Summary

`EthPeggedOracle` contract should not be used as the oracle for the frxETH as it is loosely pegged to ETH. If the price of frxETH depeg while the oracle continues to report a price of 1:1, the vaults will be overvalued or undervalued, leading to a loss of assets for the vault shareholders.

## Vulnerability Detail

Based on the codebase, the `EthPeggedOracle` is intended to be configured as the oracle for the frxETH.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/test/oracles/RootOracleIntegrationTest.t.sol#L247

```solidity
File: RootOracleIntegrationTest.t.sol
157:         ethPegOracle = new EthPeggedOracle(systemRegistry);
..SNIP..
244:         // Eth 1:1 setup
245:         priceOracle.registerMapping(WETH9_ADDRESS, IPriceOracle(address(ethPegOracle)));
246:         priceOracle.registerMapping(CURVE_ETH, IPriceOracle(address(ethPegOracle)));
247:         // priceOracle.registerMapping(FRXETH_MAINNET, IPriceOracle(address(ethPegOracle)));
```

As a result, frxETH will always be 1:1 to ETH in the system. However, the frxETH:ETH is not always 1:1. At the time of the audit, one frxETH is worth 0.998 ETH in the Curve Pool.

frxETH is designed to be a stablecoin that is loosely pegged to ETH. This means the price of frxETH could depeg from time to time based on current market conditions.

```solidity
File: EthPeggedOracle.sol
11: /// @title Price oracle for tokens we want to configure 1:1 to ETH. WETH for example
12: /// @dev getPriceEth is not a view fn to support reentrancy checks. Dont actually change state.
13: contract EthPeggedOracle is SystemComponent, IPriceOracle {
14:     constructor(ISystemRegistry _systemRegistry) SystemComponent(_systemRegistry) { }
15: 
16:     /// @inheritdoc IPriceOracle
17:     function getPriceInEth(address) external pure returns (uint256 price) {
18:         price = 1e18;
19:     }
20: }
```

## Impact

The protocol relies on the oracle to provide accurate pricing for many critical operations, such as determining the debt values of DV, calculators/stats used during the rebalancing process, NAV/shares of the LMPVault, and determining how much assets the users should receive during withdrawal.

If the price of frxETH depeg while the oracle continues to report a price of 1:1, the vaults will be overvalued or undervalued, depending on the direction of the price, leading to users being able to withdraw more or fewer assets than expected. Malicious users might also be able to arbitrage the difference for their own gain at the expense of the vault shareholders.

## Recommendation

Avoid using the `EthPeggedOracle` as the oracle for frxETH.

Consider taking reference from the newly [`sfrxEthFraxOracle`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB9af7723CfBd4469A7E8aa60B93428D648Bda99d#code) deployed by Frax that obtains prices from the following two sources:

1. Uniswap V3 time-weighted average price (TWAP) of frxETH/FRAX (TWAP duration currently is 15 minutes), and the Chainlink [FRAX/USD Oracle](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB9E1E3A9feFf48998E45Fa90847ed4D467E8BcfD).
2. The exponential moving average (EMA) of the [frxETH/ETH Curve Pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/frxeth) (EMA time currently is 2 hours), and the [Chainlink ETH/USD Oracle](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419).
