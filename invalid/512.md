# Access Control Needed
## Summary
Add Proper Access Control or Remove User defined address input

## Vulnerability Detail
Implementing access control in critical functions like this is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential exploitation by malicious entities

## Impact
Malicious attack based on no access control

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function removeDestinations(
        EnumerableSet.AddressSet storage removalQueue,
        EnumerableSet.AddressSet storage destinations,
        address[] calldata _destinations
    ) external {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _destinations.length; ++i) {
            address dAddress = _destinations[i];
            IDestinationVault destination = IDestinationVault(dAddress);
```

## Recommendation
Incorporate role-based or arbitrator-based access control within this contract to limit data modification privileges exclusively to essential contracts or users.
