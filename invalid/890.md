# Anyone can drain whole LMPVaultRouter.sol due to flawed logic in its dependencies
## Summary

The LMPVaultRouter contract inherits from the LMPVaultRouterBase contract, which itself inherits from the PeripheryPayments contract. The PeripheryPayments contract contains a function called refundETH() that lacks access controls on who can withdraw the whole contract balance . 

As a result, the same vulnerable refundETH() function gets passed on to the LMPVaultRouter contract, thereby allowing anyone to drain the entire LMPVaultRouter.sol  contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

**Here is the Vulnerable Function in PeripheryPayments contract that makes this Critical Exploit possible:**

```solidity
 function refundETH() external payable {
        if (address(this).balance > 0) Address.sendValue(payable(msg.sender), address(this).balance);
    }
```
_https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/utils/PeripheryPayments.sol#L67-L69_

You can clearly confirm, There is no access controls in place to check who can withdraw all of the funds in the contract as a result anyone can drain it with just one click.

**Now Here is the LMPVaultRouterBase.sol that inherits the above vulnerable PeripheryPayments.sol contract**
```solidity
abstract contract LMPVaultRouterBase is ILMPVaultRouterBase, SelfPermit, Multicall, PeripheryPayments {
         //REST OF THE CONTRACT CODE, ETC
}
```

_https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L15_

As a result the same vulnerable refundETH() gets inherited to LMPVaultRouterBase.sol Contract

**Which inturn Makes the LMPVaultRouter.sol contract vulnerable to the Critical Exploit because LMPVaultRouter.sol inherits from LMPVaultRouterBase.sol Contract**

```solidity
contract LMPVaultRouter is ILMPVaultRouter, LMPVaultRouterBase {
   //REST OF THE CONTRACT CODE, ETC
}
```

_https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouter.sol#L14_

Now LMPVaultRouter.sol contract has the same refundETH()  function which when triggered allows anyone to drain the whole
LMPVaultRouter.sol contract

this issue_**

## Impact

This Access Control  bug has serious and damaging implications for both your company and your users. It poses a serious risk of massive financial loss by allowing unauthorized access to drain all funds stored in the LMPVaultRouter.sol contract. Additionally, the bug can severely disrupt the main functionality of the Tokemak protocol, leading to reputational damage and serious business consequences

**Here is POC to replicate the issue**
_please note that this poc is refactored to only include functions that cause this critical exploit and make it easily compatible with [remix.ethereum.com](https://remix.ethereum.org/) testing_

contract LMPVaultRouter is LMPVaultRouterBase {}  
```
**_STEPS TO REPRODUCE_**

1- create a solidity file in remix  with above code
2- deploy LMPVaultRouter contract
3- deposit some ethers with account one by calling deposit()  function
4- change the account to any of the account given by remix (each with 100 ethers ofcourse)
5- Now Notice there is refundETH() function
6- trigger it and Notice whole contract balance is drained


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability, the refundETH() function should be modified to only allow the contract owner or authorized parties to refund the contract's ETH balance. This can be achieved by adding access control checks within the function.

Here is an example of how the refundETH() function can be modified:
```solidity
function refundETH() external payable {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can refund ETH.");
    if (address(this).balance > 0) {
        Address.sendValue(payable(msg.sender), address(this).balance);
    }
}
```
In this modified version, the refundETH() function checks if the caller is the contract owner using the msg.sender variable. If the caller is not the owner, the function will revert with an error message. Only the contract owner can successfully refund the ETH balance.

It is important to note that this fix assumes the presence of an owner variable in the contract. If such a variable does not exist, it should be added to the contract and properly initialized.
