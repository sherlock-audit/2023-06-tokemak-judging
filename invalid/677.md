# rounding in LMPDebt._calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn is against the vault
## Summary
Rounding in ERC4626 vaults are meant to favour the vault at the possible expense of the user. But the rounding done in `LMPDebt._calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn` is in favour of the user at the possible expense of the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
sharesToBurn is rounded up. The value decides how much would be taken from the value LMPVault has in DestinationVault and send to the user. The rounding were done to favor the user so they surely get **at least** the asset specified, but at the expense of the vault.
```solidity
// Calculate the portion of shares to burn based on the assets we need to pull
// and the current total debt value. These are destination vault shares.
sharesToBurn = currentDvShares.mulDiv(maxAssetsToPull, currentDvDebtValue, Math.Rounding.Up);

// This is what will be deducted from totalDebt with the withdrawal. The totalDebt number
// is calculated based on the cached values so we need to be sure to reduce it
// proportional to the original cached debt value
totalDebtBurn = cachedCurrentDebt.mulDiv(sharesToBurn, cachedDvShares, Math.Rounding.Up);
```

## Impact
Last withdrawals might not be successful and other consequences are possible because WEIs were gently taken out of the vault.
