# GPToke's `extend` function implicitly requires `duration` to be more than the old value, which shouldn't be the case.
## Summary
GPToke's `extend` function implicitly requires `duration` to be more than the old value, which shouldn't be the case. If `duration` is lower than the old value, the `extend` function will always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `extend` function, `previewPoints` is calculated based on the current block number and the given new duration. This means that if the `duration` is lower than the previous duration, the `newPoints` will always be lower than the `oldPoints`  --> the `extend` tx will revert, since the contract will try to `mint` token amount equal to `newPoints - oldPoints` .

From the calculation above, it seems the intended effect of extend is to really extend the duration (so user always ended up with more points). But the vulnerability in this case would be due to how `previewPoints` is being calculated from the current block number, instead of the previous start time. 

## Impact
Users must extend the duration for at least what they had locked for the previous round. If not, then the tx will always revert.

For example, user A locked 100 tokens for 4 years. Then, 3 years passed --> 1 year lock remaining). User A wants to extend the lock for 1 more year (1+1 = 2 years in total). However, this will revert, due to `previewPoints` getting the new point amounts less than the previously locked value --> it will revert on this particular line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L177

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Really depends on how you want to handle this, but one way is to:
- modify `previewPoints` so `duration` is calculated not from the current block timestamp, but from the previously stored `start` time, if applicable. --> this means if the user has locked for 4 years and ended up wanting to lock for 1 more year -> then the number of points he'd get for extending would be the same as locking 5 years in total.
- If you still want to maintain the same points logic, then you could handle the case when `newPoints < oldPoints` by burning the token amount instead.
