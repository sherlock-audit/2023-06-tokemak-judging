# the withdraw() function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks
## Summary
withdraw() calls out to the IExtraRewarder(extraRewards[i]).withdraw() external contract without reentrancy protection
## Vulnerability Detail
This could be exploited by:

- Attacker calls withdraw()
- The external call to IExtraRewarder is made
- The IExtraRewarder implementation executes malicious logic and recursively calls back into withdraw()
- This repeats draining funds or manipulating state

## Impact
This can lead to loss of staked tokens

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adding the nonReentrant modifier prevents reentrancy and fixes the vulnerability
