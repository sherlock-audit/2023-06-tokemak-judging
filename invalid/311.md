# Emitting events before external calls can be misleading if the calls fail
## Summary
The addLiquidity and removeLiquidity functions emit events before interacting with the Curve pool. If the external calls fail, the emitted events could be misleading.
## Vulnerability Detail
The events indicate liquidity was added or removed, before the external calls that actually do that. So if _runDeposit or _runWithdrawal were to fail, the emitted events would incorrectly suggest the liquidity actions succeeded.

## Impact
This could mislead callers of the contract into thinking deposits/withdrawals completed when they didn't

## Recommendation
The events should be emitted after the external calls
