# Missing Validation would allow Array Length Mismatch related Errors when performing Liquidation
## Summary
Missing Validation would allow performing liquidation without actually performing it or any other Array Length Mismatch related Errors when the _performLiquidation(...) function of the LiquidationRow.sol contract is called
## Vulnerability Detail
An analytical and thorough look at _performLiquidation(...) function from L240 shows that two different arrays  vaultsToLiquidate & vaultsBalances are coming in as parameters, tracking down this arrays in this function to the eventual usage of vaultsBalances array at L273 in the for loop. There was no point in time when vaultsBalances array length was confirmed to be in agreement with the length of incoming vaultsToLiquidate array before it usage, this could have bad effect when perfoming liquation with the _performLiquidation(...) function.
## Impact
Missing Validation would allow performing liquidation without actually performing it or any other Array Length Mismatch related Errors when the _performLiquidation(...) function of the LiquidationRow.sol contract is called due to events of disconnection between vaultsToLiquidate & vaultsBalances array values

```solidity
    function _performLiquidation(
     ....
        IDestinationVault[] memory vaultsToLiquidate,
      ...
        uint256[] memory vaultsBalances
    ) private {
        uint256 length = vaultsToLiquidate.length;
     ...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            IDestinationVault vaultAddress = vaultsToLiquidate[i];
            IMainRewarder mainRewarder = IMainRewarder(vaultAddress.rewarder());

            if (mainRewarder.rewardToken() != params.buyTokenAddress) {
                revert InvalidRewardToken();
            }

            uint256 amount = amountReceived * vaultsBalances[i] / totalBalanceToLiquidate;

    ....
        }
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validation to confirm array length of vaultsBalances is equal to vaultsToLiquidate array length before the loop is done will solve this vulnerability
```solidity
+++ require( vaultsBalances.length == vaultsToLiquidate.length , "Error Message")
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            IDestinationVault vaultAddress = vaultsToLiquidate[i];
            IMainRewarder mainRewarder = IMainRewarder(vaultAddress.rewarder());

            if (mainRewarder.rewardToken() != params.buyTokenAddress) {
                revert InvalidRewardToken();
            }

            uint256 amount = amountReceived * vaultsBalances[i] / totalBalanceToLiquidate;

            // approve main rewarder to pull the tokens
            LibAdapter._approve(IERC20(params.buyTokenAddress), address(mainRewarder), amount);
            mainRewarder.queueNewRewards(amount);

            emit VaultLiquidated(address(vaultAddress), fromToken, params.buyTokenAddress, amount);
            emit GasUsedForVault(address(vaultAddress), gasUsedPerVault, bytes32("liquidation"));
        }
