# There is no way to change `convexStaking` or `convexBooster` inside `CurveConvexDestinationVault`, could cause issue in the future
## Summary

Convex Finance contracts are immutable and non-upgradeable, and historically have migrate their contracts multiple times, can be caused by feature changes or exploit. However, there is no way `CurveConvexDestinationVault` can update the `convexStaking` or `convexBooster`, potentially can cause issue.

## Vulnerability Detail

It can be seen that `convexStaking` and `convexBooster` can only be set one time when contract is initialized :

```solidity
    function initialize(
        IERC20 baseAsset_,
        IERC20 underlyer_,
        IMainRewarder rewarder_,
        address[] memory additionalTrackedTokens_,
        bytes memory params_
    ) public virtual override {
        // Base class has the initializer() modifier to prevent double-setup
        // If you don't call the base initialize, make sure you protect this call
        super.initialize(baseAsset_, underlyer_, rewarder_, additionalTrackedTokens_, params_);

        // We must configure a the curve resolver to setup the vault
        ICurveResolver curveResolver = _systemRegistry.curveResolver();
        Errors.verifyNotZero(address(curveResolver), "curveResolver");

        // Decode the init params, validate, and save off
        InitParams memory initParams = abi.decode(params_, (InitParams));
        Errors.verifyNotZero(initParams.curvePool, "curvePool");
        Errors.verifyNotZero(initParams.convexStaking, "convexStaking");
        Errors.verifyNotZero(initParams.convexBooster, "convexBooster");
        Errors.verifyNotZero(initParams.convexPoolId, "convexPoolId");

        curvePool = initParams.curvePool;
        convexStaking = initParams.convexStaking;
        convexBooster = initParams.convexBooster;
        convexPoolId = initParams.convexPoolId;
        baseAssetBurnTokenIndex = initParams.baseAssetBurnTokenIndex;

        // Setup pool tokens as tracked. If we want to handle meta pools and their tokens
        // we will pass them in as additional, not currently a use case
        // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
        (address[8] memory tokens, uint256 numTokens, address lpToken,) =
            curveResolver.resolveWithLpToken(initParams.curvePool);
        Errors.verifyNotZero(lpToken, "lpToken");
        Errors.verifyNotZero(numTokens, "numTokens");

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < numTokens; ++i) {
            address weth = address(_systemRegistry.weth());
            address token = tokens[i] == LibAdapter.CURVE_REGISTRY_ETH_ADDRESS_POINTER ? weth : tokens[i];

            _addTrackedToken(token);
            constituentTokens.push(token);
        }

        if (baseAssetBurnTokenIndex > numTokens - 1) {
            revert InvalidBaseTokenBurnIndex(baseAssetBurnTokenIndex, numTokens);
        }

        // Initialize our min amounts for withdrawals to 0 for all tokens
        minAmounts = new uint256[](numTokens);

        // Checked above
        // slither-disable-next-line missing-zero-check
        curveLpToken = lpToken;
    }
```

Convex Finance contracts are immutable and non-upgradeable, a new contract had to be deployed every major feature changes and exploit, here are historical reference :

NOTE : This is not uncommon and not equal to 3rd party paused. It is simply how Convex Finance design their contracts and considered best practice to have an option to change the address when integrating with Convex.


## Impact

Once this migration happened, the `CurveConvexDestinationVault` interaction with convex will be broken and there is no way to fix it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider to add admin functions to change  `convexStaking` and `convexBooster` address.
