# Incompatibility with ERC-20 Tokens without Boolean Return on `approve`
## Summary
The contract exhibits incompatibility with certain ERC-20 tokens, such as USDT, due to the use of the `approve` function without handling tokens that do not return a boolean value. This can lead to failed transactions and hinder the successful execution of the `depositAndStake` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositAndStake` function within the contract aims to deposit and stake Curve LP tokens by utilizing the `approve` function to set spending allowances. However, this approach can encounter issues when dealing with ERC-20 tokens that do not adhere to the standard behavior of returning a boolean value indicating the success of the approval.
```solidity
LibAdapter._approve(IERC20(lpToken), address(booster), amount);
```
## Impact
The impact of this issue is that tokens that do not return a boolean value from the `approve` function, such as USDT, cannot be successfully used with the `depositAndStake` function. This results in failed transaction executions and users being unable to deposit and stake these tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this compatibility issue, the contract should adopt the `safeApprove` function from OpenZeppelin's ERC-20 library. The `safeApprove` function is designed to handle both types of token implementations, allowing the `depositAndStake` function to be compatible with tokens that do not return a boolean value from the `approve` function. The modified code snippet is as follows:
```solidity
LibAdapter.safeApprove(IERC20(lpToken), address(booster), amount);
```
