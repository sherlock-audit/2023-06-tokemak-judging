# Incorrect implementation of the LibAdapter._approve() function.
## Summary

An unspent allowance may cause a denial of service during the calls to _approve() in BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol, CurveV2FactoryCryptoAdapter.sol, MaverickAdapter.sol and other contracts.

For some tokens, to set allowance, you must first reset the current allowance value. For example, USDT is such a token. A similar issue is documented at https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#approval-race-protections.

## Vulnerability Detail

In LibAdapter._approve() (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/libs/LibAdapter.sol #L19-L25) tried to do similar logic but made a mistake.

function _approve(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 amount) internal {
     uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
     if (currentAllowance > 0) {
         token.safeDecreaseAllowance(spender, currentAllowance);
     }
     token.safeIncreaseAllowance(spender, amount);
}

The currentAllowance parameter gets the spender's current allowance:
uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);

Next, it checks that currentAllowance is greater than 0, i.e. value already set:
if (currentAllowance > 0)

There is an error in the line token.safeDecreaseAllowance(spender, currentAllowance). The currentAllowance parameter must be set to 0 to reset the current allowance. Then you need to determine the increase or decrease required for approve.

Due to a current bug, functions that use _approve() may not work correctly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

token.safeDecreaseAllowance(spender, 0);
Then you need to determine the increase or decrease required for approve.
