# `ConvexRewards.claimRewards` doesn't send all the rewards to `sendTo`
## Summary

`ConvexRewards.claimRewards` doesn't send all the rewards to `sendTo`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   function claimRewards(
        address gauge,
        address defaultToken,
        address sendTo
    ) public returns (uint256[] memory amounts, address[] memory tokens) {
        return _claimRewards(gauge, defaultToken, sendTo);
    }
```
`claimRewards` calls a internal `_claimRewards`  which claim rewards from the pool at line [89](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/destinations/adapters/rewards/ConvexRewardsAdapter.sol#L89) 
```solidity
 // claim rewards
89        bool result = rewardPool.getReward(account, true);
90       if (!result) {
91          revert RewardAdapter.ClaimRewardsFailed();
92       }
```
hence the protocol receives all the protocol including slash tokens but only transfer un slash token rewards to `sendTo`
```solidity
 // get balances after and calculate amounts claimed
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalLength; ++i) {
            uint256 balance = 0;
            // Same check for "stash tokens"
            if (IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).totalSupply() > 0) {
                balance = IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).balanceOf(account);
            }

            amountsClaimed[i] = balance - balancesBefore[i];

            if (sendTo != address(this) && amountsClaimed[i] > 0) {
                IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(sendTo, amountsClaimed[i]);
            }
        }
```

during sending rewards to `sendTo` this loop only transfer rewards for tokens which are not slash tokens.


## Impact

everytime protocol claims rewards he will get rewards of slash tokens but doesn't transfer to sendTo address

## Code Snippet

see above

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Protocol team accepted that they can recover these slash tokens via `recover` from `destination vault ` but they won't able to sent to actual sendTo address. 
this will be good solution when sendTo is contract address itself but if not storing  sendTo to slashtoken can be a good mitigation 
PS. doesn't have good knowledge so by researching more a good solution can be implemented
