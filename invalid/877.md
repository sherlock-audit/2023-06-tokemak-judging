# GPToke points distribution is extremely unfair to early stakers, and gives an incentive for attackers to steal honest users points

## Summary

The `previewPoints()` function in the given code calculates rewards or points for stakers based on the duration of their stake. However, the current calculation does not differentiate between early stakers and late stakers, leading to inequitable reward distribution and incentivizing malicious actions, since an attacker can just come stake on the last available time, i.e stake for a duration of _minStakeDuration_ and still receive rewards same with staking on the first day

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function stake(uint256 amount, uint256 duration, address to) external {
        _stake(amount, duration, to);
    }

      function _stake(uint256 amount, uint256 duration, address to) internal whenNotPaused {

        }

        // checkpoint rewards for caller
        _collectRewards(to, false);

        // save information for current lockup
        lockups[to].push(Lockup({ amount: uint128(amount), end: uint128(end), points: points }));

        // create points for user
        _mint(to, points);

        emit Stake(to, lockups[to].length - 1, amount, end, points);

        // transfer staked toke in
        toke.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }


        function previewPoints(uint256 amount, uint256 duration) public view returns (uint256 points, uint256 end) {

        if (duration < minStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooShort();
        if (duration > maxStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooLong();

        // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
        uint256 start = block.timestamp > startEpoch ? block.timestamp : startEpoch;
        end = start + duration;

        // calculate points based on duration from staking end date
        //@audit
        uint256 endYearpoc = ((end - startEpoch) * 1e18) / 365 days;
        uint256 multiplier = PRBMathUD60x18.pow(YEAR_BASE_BOOST, endYearpoc);

        points = (amount * multiplier) / 1e18;

As seen at this [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L184), in as much as the duration is not less than the minimum acceptable value the staking request would be accepted.

Now the crux of this issue arises from the hardcoded computation in the `endYearpoc` calculation:

> endYearpoc = `(end - startEpoch) * 1e18) / 365 days`

Regardless of when a user starts staking, the calculation assumes every staker began at `startEpoch`.

POC:

- `minStakeDuration` has been set to X days, _for POC reasons lets use 2 months, 60 days_
- Alice is an early believer of the project and finds out she can stake her GPTokens
- Alice goes ahead and stakes 10m amount of GPTokens on the next day after the staking process starts, i.e _she staked for `maxStakeDuration - 1 day == 1460 days`_
- Bob on the other hand doesn't believe in the project and cause of that waits for 1399 days to pass in order to see if the project can last the test of time, and on the 1400th day, Bob also stakes 10m amount of GPTokens
- Staking duration ends
- Alice and Bob both call `unstake()` to receive rewards and both receive the same amount of rewards which is unfair on Alice

## Impact

Users staking for `minStakeDuration` would receive rewards equivalent to those who staked for `maxStakeDuration` which seems like a steal of the early stakers rewards, since they are the one taking the most.

## Tool used

Manual Audit

## Recommendation

The formula should be adjusted to consider the actual staking timestamp of each user. If the condition `block.timestamp > startEpoch` holds true, the formula should be modified as:

> endYearpoc = (end - block.timestamp) \* 1e18 / 365 days

This way the longer a user stakes the more rewards they receive
