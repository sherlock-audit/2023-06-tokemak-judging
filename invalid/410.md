# manipulation due to reentrancy vulnerability in the claimsVaultRewards()
## Summary
the nonReentrant modifier in the LiquidationRow contract does not prevent reentrancy within the loop in the claimsVaultRewards() function. This means that if one of the calls made inside the loop were to call back into the LiquidationRow contract, it  would lead to a reentrancy vulnerability.
## Vulnerability Detail
 the nonReentrant modifier in the claimsVaultRewards() function does not prevent reentrancy within the loop. This is because the nonReentrant modifier only prevents reentry at the function level it is applied to, it does not prevent reentrancy in internal calls made from that fuThe nonReentrant modifier prevents reentering the claimsVaultRewards function, but does not prevent reentrancy within the loop. 
Inside the loop, each call to vault.collectRewards() could in theory call back into LiquidationRow before the _status is reset back to 0. 

So if vault.collectRewards() calls back into the contract, it could reenter and cause issues:
- It could manipulate the vaults array while it is still being iterated, leading to unexpected behavior
- It could call claimsVaultRewards again, starting a new iteration before the previous one finished
This introduces a reentrancy vulnerability. An attacker could construct malicious vault contracts to exploit this 

A malicious vault contract could call back into claimsVaultRewards() recursively in its collectRewards() function before the loop finishes iterating. This would allow it to collect rewards multiple times before balances are updated. 

## Impact
Attacker can  controls flow and can drain funds or manipulate state

## Recommendation
 nonReentrant modifier needs to be applied within the loop as well
