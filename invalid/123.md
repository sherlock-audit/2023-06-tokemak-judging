# Risk of Outdated Prices in Oracle Queries
## Summary
The smart contract `SwEthEthOracle` retrieves prices from an external oracle for the `swEth` (Swell Eth) token. However, due to various factors, the oracle might provide outdated or incorrect prices, leading to stale prices being used in the contract's calculations.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `SwEthEthOracle` contract's purpose is to fetch the price of the `swEth` token in terms of Ether (ETH). It implements the `getPriceInEth` function, which takes a token address as an argument and returns the corresponding price in 1e18 precision.

However, the contract does not account for potential stale prices provided by the oracle. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that the `getPriceInEth` function is defined as a view function, meaning it does not modify the contract's state and is expected to return consistent results across multiple calls.

The vulnerability can be described using the provided code snippet:
```solidity
function getPriceInEth(address token) external view returns (uint256 price) {
    if (token != address(swEth)) revert Errors.InvalidToken(token);
    price = swEth.swETHToETHRate();
}
```
If the external oracle experiences delays in fetching and updating the `swEth` token's price, the `swETHToETHRate` function may return an outdated price that does not accurately reflect the current market value.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that the `SwEthEthOracle` contract might return and use stale prices for calculations. These stale prices can lead to incorrect financial decisions, such as mispricing assets, inaccurate trading, and imbalanced portfolios.
