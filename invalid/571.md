# Outperforming assets are sold
## Summary

Outperforming assets are sold, resulting in lower-than-expected returns for the vault, leading to a loss for the vault shareholders.

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the source code's comment below, if a Destination Vault is at a loss, users can only burn an amount proportional to their ownership of this vault. The reason is that burning all the shares in this vault will lock in the loss for the entire vault.

On the other hand, if the DV is sitting at a profit, the users can burn all the shares. By burning the shares of profitable DV, it is effectively locking in the profit for the vault.

This approach has its downside. Examining it from another perspective, the underlying assets of profitable DVs are likely those that outperform, yielding above-average returns. Otherwise, the DV would not be profitable in the first place. 

From an economic theory standpoint, these are precisely the assets one should retain rather than sell, thereby ensuring exposure to potential upsides, while the underperforming assets should be disposed of to curtail further losses.

However, the vault did the opposite by selling off outperforming assets while keeping underperforming assets, leading to lower-than-expected returns for the vault.

```solidity
function _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
    DestinationInfo storage destInfo,
    IDestinationVault destVault,
    uint256 userShares,
    uint256 maxAssetsToPull,
    uint256 totalVaultShares
) external returns (uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) {
    // Figure out how many shares we can burn from the destination as well
    // as what our totalDebt deduction should be (totalDebt being a cached value).
    // If the destination vault is currently sitting at a profit, then the user can burn
    // all the shares this vault owns. If its at a loss, they can only burn an amount
    // proportional to their ownership of this vault. This is so a user doesn't lock in
    // a loss for the entire vault during their withdrawal
```

## Impact

Resulted in lower-than-expected returns for the vault, leading to a loss for the vault shareholders.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider a more sophisticated algorithm to avoid burning most of the profitable DV shares. Otherwise, consider burning the shares in proportion.
