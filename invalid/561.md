# Incorrect asset price might be returned if the Chainlink registry returns price outside of min/max range
## Summary
Chainlink aggregators include a circuit breaker that prevents asset prices from going beyond a predefined range. This feature could lead the oracle to consistently return the minPrice instead of the real asset price if there's a substantial drop, as observed during the LUNA crash.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here, the price is just checked to be over zero and does not check for the upper limit.
```solidity
    (uint80 roundId, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = chainlinkOracle.oracle.latestRoundData();
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint256 oracleStoredTimeout = uint256(chainlinkOracle.pricingTimeout);
        uint256 tokenPricingTimeout = oracleStoredTimeout == 0 ? DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT : oracleStoredTimeout;
        if (
            roundId == 0 || price <= 0 || updatedAt == 0 || updatedAt > timestamp
                || updatedAt < timestamp - tokenPricingTimeout
        ) revert InvalidDataReturned();
```

## Impact
Incorrect price might be returned during market crash.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
use the proper minPrice and maxPrice for each asset
