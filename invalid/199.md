# stakers can reduce their staking duration
## Summary
instead of extending their staking duration, stakers are able to decrease their staking duration
## Vulnerability Detail
when extending the staking duration, the `previewPoints` method is called with the old amount and the duration for extension. it then gives back the new points and the new end.
the new end is then assigned to `lockup.end`. this should not be case as `previewPoints` calculates the end by adding the start and duration. 

here is a scenario to consider 
if at first alice staked on the 1st of the month for 15 days, then the end would be on the 16th day. with 5 days being the minimum stake duration.

she decides to extend the duration by 10 more days before the epoch starts, now the end becomes on the 26th day.

on paper this is what should happen, however in the `previewPoints` the end will be startEpoch + duration. which is the first day + 10 days. so the end date will now be on the 11th effectively shortening the staking period



## Impact
stakers could bring their end dates closer instead of actually extending them

Manual Review
the newEnd should be added to the oldEnd
