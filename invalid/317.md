# recover() function can prevent recovering critical tokens if they are accidentally added to the _trackedTokens set
## Summary
The recover() function allows anyone with the TOKEN_RECOVERY_ROLE to withdraw any tokens from the contract, except for tracked tokens. However, an admin could accidentally add a critical token like the baseAsset or underlying to the _trackedTokens set. This would then prevent recovering those tokens.

The _trackedTokens set is initialized with [Link 3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L93-L94)  If an admin later accidentally adds another critical token like WETH to this set then the recover() function would prevent withdrawing that token, since it does [Link 4](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L308)
## Impact
This could lock critical funds in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
The recover() function could be changed to explicitly allow withdrawing critical tokens like baseAsset, underlying etc no matter if they are tracked
