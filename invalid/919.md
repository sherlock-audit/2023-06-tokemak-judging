# Anyone can call the PeripheryPayments sweepToken() stealing the protocol fees
## Summary
PeripheryPayments is a dependency of the LMPVaultRouterBase abstract contract, which is a dependency of the LMPVaultRouter contract. PeripheryPayments has a sweepToken() with no access control which allows a caller to transfer any token from the LMPVaultRouter contract to any recipient.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function sweepToken(IERC20 token, uint256 amountMinimum, address recipient) public payable {
        uint256 balanceToken = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (balanceToken < amountMinimum) revert InsufficientToken();

        if (balanceToken > 0) {
            token.safeTransfer(recipient, balanceToken);
        }
    }
```

## Impact
Anyone can take the protocol fees stored in the LMPVaultRouter contract.

## Code Snippet
Dependencies

```solidity
contract LMPVaultRouter is ILMPVaultRouter, LMPVaultRouterBase {
```

```solidity
abstract contract LMPVaultRouterBase is ILMPVaultRouterBase, SelfPermit, Multicall, PeripheryPayments {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove or add access control to the PeripheryPayments sweepToken() function.
