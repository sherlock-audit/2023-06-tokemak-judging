# ERC4626Router Token Swap Sensitivity to Market Conditions
## Summary
The ERC4626Router contract's `swapAndDepositToVault` function in `LMPVaultRouter` contract poses a potential slippage risk during token swaps. This risk may lead to variance in the amount of tokens received after executing the swap. While users can specify a `minSharesOut` parameter to account for slippage, the actual `amountReceived` may still deviate from their expectations.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `swapAndDepositToVault` function in the ERC4626Router contract facilitates token swaps using an external `swapper` contract. As a result, executing a token swap, especially for large swap orders, can be subject to slippage.
```solidity
 /// @inheritdoc ILMPVaultRouter
    function swapAndDepositToVault(
        address swapper,
        SwapParams memory swapParams,
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 minSharesOut
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
        systemRegistry.asyncSwapperRegistry().verifyIsRegistered(swapper);
        pullToken(IERC20(swapParams.sellTokenAddress), swapParams.sellAmount, address(this));

        // verify that the swap is for the vault asset
        if (swapParams.buyTokenAddress != vault.asset()) revert Errors.InvalidParams();

        bytes memory data = swapper.functionDelegateCall(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("swap((address,uint256,address,uint256,bytes,bytes))", swapParams), "SwapFailed"
        );

        uint256 amountReceived = abi.decode(data, (uint256));

        return _deposit(vault, to, amountReceived, minSharesOut);
    }

```
Slippage occurs when the token price changes between the initiation and execution of the swap. The `amountReceived` after the swap depends on various factors, such as the liquidity in the swap pool and the size of the swap order. As a result, the actual `amountReceived` may differ from the user's initial expectation, potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes.
## Impact
 Users may receive fewer tokens than they intended, leading to a less favorable exchange rate and reducing the overall value of their trades. This can result in financial losses, particularly if the slippage is significant.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Slippage protection parameters should be included. Like integrating a reliable on-chain price oracle, the contract can access real-time token price data, ensuring accurate token swaps and reducing the impact of slippage.
