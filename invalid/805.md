# DestinationVault rewards can be forcefully locked in the LMPVault
## Summary

The LMPVault holds shares in different DestinationVaults. Each DestinationVault also has a MainRewarder attach to it, in which the LMPVault will hold a balance. These rewards should be correctly withdrawn and accounted for in the `totalIdle` count, however by doing a zero-value transfer of DestinationVault shares, the rewards are forcefully sent to the LMPVault and become locked and unaccounted for.

## Vulnerability Detail

The LMPVault holds shares in different DestinationVaults. Each DestinationVault also has a MainRewarder attach to it, in which the LMPVault will hold a balance. Any time the LMPVault deposits more base assets into the DestinationVault, their MainRewarder balance also increases. The MainRewarder of the DestinationVault also emits base asset rewards.

Normally, these rewards are withdrawn in `LMPVault.sol:_updateDebtReporting` on line 773:
```solidity
uint256 beforeBaseAsset = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
IMainRewarder(destVault.rewarder()).getReward(address(this), false);
uint256 claimedRewardValue = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - beforeBaseAsset;
idleIncrease += claimedRewardValue;
```
And consequently added to the `idleIncrease` value.

However, the DestinationVault implements ERC20 and overrides the transfer hooks on lines 335-343:
```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
    if (from == to) {
        return;
    }

    if (from != address(0)) {
        _rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
    }
}
```

Where the parameter value `claim` is `true` and so the rewards will be claimed for the `from` address in `MainRewards.sol:withdraw`:

```solidity
function withdraw(address account, uint256 amount, bool claim) public onlyStakeTracker {
    _updateReward(account);
    _withdraw(account, amount);

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < extraRewards.length; ++i) {
        IExtraRewarder(extraRewards[i]).withdraw(account, amount);
    }

    if (claim) {
        _processRewards(account, true);
    }
}
```

The contract uses OpenZeppelin's ERC20 implementation, which allows for arbitrary 0-value transfers from any address and so an attacker can initiate such a transfer, force a claim of the base assets rewards for the LMPVault and the rewards would be sent to the LMPVault, but not accounted for in `idleIncrease`.

The base asset rewards would also be locked, as the recovery mechanism does not allow for recovering the base asset.

## Impact

Any attacker can force the claiming of base asset rewards for an LMPVault after which they will be locked in the contract and accounted for in the value, directly leading to a loss of user yield.

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode

## Recommendation

Either disallow 0-value transfers in the DestinationVault or add some mechanism in the LMPVault that allows for syncing `totalIdle` with `balanceOf` correctly.
