# Use Check-Effect-Interaction pattern in the claimRewards function
## Summary

Possible Re-Entrancy possible due to external call despite re-entrancy guard

## Vulnerability Detail

In the code segment from lines 43 to 57, the initial balance is recorded, followed by an external call to a user-defined address, and then the state of amountClaimed is updated. Despite the presence of a Re-Entrancy Mutex Guard, a potential vulnerability exists. A malicious user could exploit this by calling another contract that uses a delegate call to impersonate the BeethovenRewardsAdapter contract. This could result in a loop that claims as many rewards tokens as possible, only ceasing when completed, leading to a discrepancy between the balance of rewards in the reward helper and amountClaimed.

If the reward helper lacks a bookkeeping function, it could allow a user to drain the funds from the rewards contract.

In the final stage of this potential exploit, to evade detection, the majority of the tokens are transferred to another account before returning. This allows the contract to read the new balance and report an inaccurate amount of tokens claimed, based on the remaining balance of reward tokens.

A potential malicious code example is as follows:

```solidity
function claimRewards(address guageContract, address account){
   // Delegate call in a loop to actual GAUGE_REWARD_HELPER.claimRewards(gaugeContract, account)
// Continue claiming until reaching max limit either by bookkeeping or funds depletion
// Transfer tokens to another address
// Return
}
```

## Impact

Possible Funds Drain

## Code Snippet

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
            IERC20 token = streamer.reward_tokens(i);
            rewardTokens[i] = token;
            balancesBefore[i] = token.balanceOf(account);
        }

        // claim rewards
        GAUGE_REWARD_HELPER.claimRewards(gaugeContract, account);

        // get balances after and calculate amounts claimed
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
            uint256 balance = rewardTokens[i].balanceOf(account);

            uint256 claimed = balance - balancesBefore[i];
            amountsClaimed[i] = claimed;
        }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To enhance the security of your smart contract, we recommend the following measures:

1. Implement Access Control: This will regulate who can access the contract. However, we understand that this may not always be feasible. If so, we suggest eliminating the option for users to input the reward token. Instead, hardcode it and include an admin-protected function to update the token address.

2. Modify Claim Calculation: We propose two alternatives for this. The first is to utilize a view function from the rewards helper to obtain the predicted claim amount. Alternatively, you could incorporate the reward calculation function directly into the contract.

These recommendations aim to bolster the security and efficiency of your smart contract.
