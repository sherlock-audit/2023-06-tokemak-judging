# Missing withdraw_admin_fees Function in Certain Curve Pools Exposes Vulnerability to Read-Only Reentrancy Attacks
## Summary
Some implementations of Curve pool contracts lack the `withdraw_admin_fees` function, making them potentially vulnerable to read-only reentrancy attacks when queried for their virtual price.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract `CurveV1PoolRebasingStatsCalculator` attempts to mitigate [read-only reentrancy attacks](https://chainsecurity.com/curve-lp-oracle-manipulation-post-mortem/) by invoking the `withdraw_admin_fees` function before querying the `get_virtual_price` function of a Curve pool. The intent behind this is that if an attacker tries a reentrancy attack during the `get_virtual_price` query, the `withdraw_admin_fees` function would revert, thwarting the attack.
1. src/oracles/providers/CurveV1StableEthOracle.sol : 
```solidity
if (iToken == LibAdapter.CURVE_REGISTRY_ETH_ADDRESS_POINTER) {
      //E check if pool must check for reentrancy
      if (poolInfo.checkReentrancy == 1) {
          // This will fail in reentrancy because of the reentrancy check in the function
          ICurveOwner(pool.owner()).withdraw_admin_fees(address(pool));
      }
  }

  // Our prices are always in 1e18
  //E get price using rootPriceOracle.sol
  uint256 tokenPrice = systemRegistry.rootPriceOracle().getPriceInEth(iToken);
  //E adjust minPrice if needed
  if (tokenPrice < minPrice) {
      minPrice = tokenPrice;
  }
```
2. src/stats/calculators/CurveV1PoolRebasingStatsCalculator.sol
```solidity
ICurveOwner(pool.owner()).withdraw_admin_fees(address(pool)); // should revert if read-only reentrancy
return pool.get_virtual_price();
```
However, not all Curve pools have implemented `withdraw_admin_fees`. Some use `claim_admin_fees`, some does not implement it at all and others restrict its use to the pool `owner`. Additionally, even when present, the `withdraw_admin_fees` function doesn't always activate the reentrancy lock, leaving potential vulnerabilities.
Specifically, the pools with missing or inadequate implementations include:

## Impact
Having discussed with Tokemak team ,they are well aware of the risk of this vulnerability, that's how it is handled which present a risk of having a curve pool balance and a curve total supply in a Pool not matching.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability in affected pools by a read-only reentrancy attack. If successful, they might obtain unintended benefits like inflated rewards or misleading data, depending on the protocol's interaction with the pool's virtual price.
The attack can be resumed as : 
1. Deposit large amounts of liquidity in a Curve Pool.
2. Remove liquidity.
3. During the callback perform malicious actions.
4. Profit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use other function with the same modifier or updated pools with the `withdraw_admin_fees` function implemented.
Another way is to go with the gas limitation method ,[ Silopedia wrote a good article about how to mitigate it](https://silopedia.silo.finance/risks/curve-read-only-reentrancy-in-a-few-sentences#is-it-possible-to-do-better) : `"So, everything that we need to ensure that the pool is not locked is to pass this limit by the gas consumption. For example, we can set a gas limit for the call 3000; if the call consumes 3000 of gas, we know it is NOT locked, and we can be sure we are not under attack. This solution is 2â€“35 times cheaper than proposed by the ChainSecurity team and will work for ANY Curve pool."`
