# Incorrect calculation of GPToke amount
## Summary
The calculation of GPToke amount is incorrect. The amount of GPToke minted for staking should be related to duration but it is only related to end time, not duration. 

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
File: GPToke.sol
182:     /// @inheritdoc IGPToke
183:     function previewPoints(uint256 amount, uint256 duration) public view returns (uint256 points, uint256 end) {
184:         if (duration < minStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooShort();
185:         if (duration > maxStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooLong();
186: 
187:         // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
188:         uint256 start = block.timestamp > startEpoch ? block.timestamp : startEpoch;
189:         end = start + duration;
190: 
191:         // calculate points based on duration from staking end date
192:         uint256 endYearpoc = ((end - startEpoch) * 1e18) / 365 days;
193:         uint256 multiplier = PRBMathUD60x18.pow(YEAR_BASE_BOOST, endYearpoc);
194: 
195:         points = (amount * multiplier) / 1e18;
196:     }
```
Incorrectly, ‘endYearpoc’ is calculated in L192.
‘endYearpoc’ is related only to end time of staking, so a user staked for longer duration might receive smaller amount of GPToke than a user for shorter duration.
This incorrect calculation breaks the system that gives reward to users according to their staking amount and duration.

If this is an error and is fixed then GPToke.extend() method would become trouble.
```solidity
File: GPToke.sol
157:     /// @inheritdoc IGPToke
158:     function extend(uint256 lockupId, uint256 duration) external whenNotPaused {
...
164:         // duration checked inside previewPoints
165:         Lockup storage lockup = lockups[msg.sender][lockupId];
166:         uint256 oldAmount = lockup.amount;
167:         uint256 oldEnd = lockup.end;
168:         uint256 oldPoints = lockup.points;
169: 
170:         (uint256 newPoints, uint256 newEnd) = previewPoints(oldAmount, duration);
171: 
172:         if (newEnd <= oldEnd) revert ExtendDurationTooShort();
173:         lockup.end = uint128(newEnd);
174:         lockup.points = newPoints;
175:         lockups[msg.sender][lockupId] = lockup;
176:         // issue extra points for extension
177:         _mint(msg.sender, newPoints - oldPoints);
...
180:     }
```
In above code's L177, newPoints can be smaller than oldPoints even if newEnd is greater than oldEnd. In this case, L177 will revert.
I think this is not intended system design and so must be fixed as well.

## Impact
This issue causes to mint incorrect amount of GPToke when a user calls following external functions – stake, extend.
