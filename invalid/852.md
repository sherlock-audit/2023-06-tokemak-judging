# First depositor can break minting of LMPVault shares

## Summary

Classic ERC4626 first depositor issue with vaults where the initial depositor can manipulate and influence future prices and even steal funds

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary, also key to note that while there is the rounding mechanism that could _somewhat_ help this, used in instances when fees are being changed to shares this is not a constant practise, and when a user is depositing via `deposit()`, `previewdeposit()` is called which essentially executes the `_convertToShares()` function with `Math.Rounding down` showcasing the issue.

## Impact

First depositor could easily steal funds due to truncation in conversions of assets/shares

## Code Snippet

Relevant portion from can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L587-L592)

```solidity
    function _convertToShares(uint256 assets, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();

        // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
        shares = (assets == 0 || supply == 0) ? assets : assets.mulDiv(supply, totalAssets(), rounding);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Audit

## Recommendation

- Enforce a minimum deposit that can't be withdrawn.
- Send some of the initial amount to the zero address.

> NB: Most legit first depositors will mint thousands of shares, so not a big cost.
