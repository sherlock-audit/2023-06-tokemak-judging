# ConvexAdapter does not check if the booster is shut down
## Summary
[_validatePoolInfo](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/staking/ConvexAdapter.sol#L105C14-L111)  does not check if the given booster is shut down.
## Vulnerability Detail
As with convex [docs](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinanceintegration/booster#pool-info) `booster.poolInfo` also returns `shutdown`, which in this contract is [not checked](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/staking/ConvexAdapter.sol#L108-L110). It is recommended [to check](https://blog.pessimistic.io/convex-finance-defi-integration-tips-1bacfe73d3ce) if the given booster is down before using it. If down the whole transaction will revert causing a DoS on every operation that include staking/withdrawing with convex.

## Impact
DoS on every contract that interacts with this booster and convex.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if the booster is down.
```diff
    function _validatePoolInfo(IConvexBooster booster, uint256 poolId, address lpToken, address staking) private view {
        // Partial return values are intentionally ignored. This call provides the most efficient way to get the data.
        // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
-      (address poolLpToken,,, address crvRewards,,) = booster.poolInfo(poolId);
+      (address poolLpToken,,, address crvRewards,, bool shutdown) = booster.poolInfo(poolId);
        if (lpToken != poolLpToken) revert PoolIdLpTokenMismatch();
        if (staking != crvRewards) revert PoolIdStakingMismatch();
+      if(shutdown)  revert Shutdown();       
    }
```
