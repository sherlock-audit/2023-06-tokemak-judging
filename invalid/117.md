# External getReward() Method Bypasses Pausing Mechanism
## Summary

The LMPVault.sol contract contains a `claimRewards()` function that is designed to be accessible only when the contract isn't paused. However, the underlying logic for claiming rewards, represented by the external `getReward()` and `getReward(address account)` method in the rewarder contracts extraRewarder.sol and MainRewarder.sol  can be directly accessed without any pausing check, potentially bypassing the intended restriction.

## Vulnerability Detail

In LMPVault.sol, the claimRewards() function uses the whenNotPaused modifier to prevent the function from being called when the contract is paused:
```solidity
function claimRewards() public whenNotPaused {
    rewarder.getReward(msg.sender, true);
}
```
However, the `getReward()` function in the MainRewarder.sol contract, which performs the core logic of rewarding, is an external function without any pausing checks:
```solidity
function getReward() external nonReentrant {
    // ... reward logic ...
}
```

and in ExtraRewarder.sol 
```solidity
    //E update and retrieve rewards
    function getReward(address account) public nonReentrant { //E @audit-issue not pausable mechanism
        //E update user reward
        _updateReward(account);
        //E distribute rewards
        _getReward(account);
    }

    //E getReward of msg.sender
    function getReward() external { //E @audit-issue not pausable mechanism
        getReward(msg.sender);
    }
```

This means that even if the LMPVault contract is paused, a user can still directly call `getReward()` on the rewarder contract and claim rewards.

## Impact

**Paused mechanisms bypass** which could lead to unwanted consequences for users or protocol when the contract should be paused or when it restarts.

## Recommendation

Implement `whenNotPaused()` on the MainRewarder contract or restrict access to this function to be accessed only by LMPVault.sol
