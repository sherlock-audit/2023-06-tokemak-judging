# ETH address not set in `CurveV2CryptoEthOracle`
## Summary
The address of ETH is not set, therefore leads to the contracts functions reverting.

## Vulnerability Detail

The address of ETH is wrongly set:
```solidity
address public constant ETH = 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE;
```
It then leads to `registerPool` not working properly:

```solidity
    function registerPool(address curvePool, address curveLpToken, bool checkReentrancy) external onlyOwner {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(curvePool, "curvePool");
        Errors.verifyNotZero(curveLpToken, "curveLpToken");
        if (lpTokenToPool[curveLpToken].pool != address(0)) revert AlreadyRegistered(curveLpToken);

        (address[8] memory tokens, uint256 numTokens, address lpToken, bool isStableSwap) =
            curveResolver.resolveWithLpToken(curvePool);

        // Only two token pools compatible with this contract.
        if (numTokens != 2) revert InvalidNumTokens(numTokens);
        if (isStableSwap) revert NotCryptoPool(curvePool);
        if (lpToken != curveLpToken) revert ResolverMismatch(curveLpToken, lpToken);

        // Only need ability to check for read-only reentrancy for pools containing native Eth.
        //@audit this will revert everytime
        if (checkReentrancy) {
            if (tokens[0] != ETH && tokens[1] != ETH) revert MustHaveEthForReentrancy();
        }

        /**
         * Curve V2 pools always price second token in `coins` array in first token in `coins` array.  This means that
         *    if `coins[0]` is Weth, and `coins[1]` is rEth, the price will be rEth as base and weth as quote.  Hence
         *    to get lp price we will always want to use the second token in the array, priced in eth.
         */
        lpTokenToPool[lpToken] =
            PoolData({ pool: curvePool, checkReentrancy: checkReentrancy ? 1 : 0, tokenToPrice: tokens[1] });

        emit TokenRegistered(lpToken);
    }
```

## Impact
`registerPool` will always revert. No pools can be registered.
