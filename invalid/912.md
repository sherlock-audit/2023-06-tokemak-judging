# calculateAnnualizedChangeMinZero and calculateUnannualizedNegativeChange formula are inconsistent and do not make sense
## Summary

The formula for calculateAnnualizedChangeMinZero and calculateUnannualizedNegativeChange are inconsistent and do not make sense

## Vulnerability Detail

The formula for the function calculateAnnualizedChangeMinZero does not make sense. 


Here the formula subtracts 1e18 from the unannualized change

In traditional finance, 1 is subtracted from annualized change to show a percentage that is less than 1. In this context, subtracting 1e18 is arbitrary, doesn't make sense and will unnecessary lead to an incorrect result for the calculator.

Additionally the formula also divides the unannualized by the the time difference, which is also unnecessary and incorrect when you compare it with the calculation for Unannualizednegativechange.

It makes no sense to divide the calculateAnnualizedChangeMinZero by the timedifference (endTimestamp - startTimestamp) and not do the same for calculateUnannualizedNegativeChange when the latter should also take into account the time periods 


## Impact

Inconsistent calculations due to arbitrary subtractions as well as an inconsistent division of the time difference could result in the wrong results for the calculator

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Review the formulas for both functions and more importantly make the calculations consistent. If you are going to divide the timedifference in calculateAnnualizedChangeMinZero then it should be done for calculateUnannualizedNegativeChange as well. The same logic should be applied if you choose not to do it.
