# Shouldn't use block.timestamp as the deadline when interact with AMM
## Summary

When swap sell token, user txs may pending in the memory forever because protocol use `block.timestamp` as deadline.


## Vulnerability Detail

When passing `block.timestamp` as the deadline parameter to a pool, means that whenever the miner decides to include the tx in a block, it will be valid at that time, since `block.timestamp` will be the current timestamp. A malicious miner can hold the transaction when there is profitable, so the tx maybe pending in the memory forever.

## Impact

Users txs may pending in the memory forever.

## Recommendation
