# LMPVaultRouterBase will not allow to make multiple native deposits using Multicall
## Summary
LMPVaultRouterBase will not allow to make multiple native deposits using Multicall, because multicall uses delegate call.
## Vulnerability Detail
`LMPVaultRouterBase` extends `Multicall` contract, which allows to batch calls to the router.
Multicall [uses delegate call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/utils/Multicall.sol#L18) in order to execute calls. This means that `msg.value` will be send for each call.

`LMPVaultRouterBase` [supports eth payment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L30), so it is possible that user would like to provide payment in native asset.

So following scenarios will not work.
1.When user would like to do several deposits with native payment.
2.When user wants to do 1 deposit with native payment and other deposits in weth(because msg.value still will be not 0).
3.When user withdraws from any vault and [ask to `unwrapWETH`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L78), and he has next tx to deposit with native payment(then all balance will be sent to user and nothing is present in balance to deposit). In this example it's even possible to user to loose funds(in case if [`to` address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L75) is not user's account, but someone else.
## Impact
LMPVaultRouterBase multicall will not work in some cases.
