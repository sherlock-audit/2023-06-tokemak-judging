# Functionality of multicall is seriously limited due to usage of msg.value and missing payable modifiers
## Summary
Missing `payable` modifier in LMPVaultRouterBase#redeem and #withdraw, alongside with using `msg.value` over `address(this).balance` in #_processEthIn, significantly restrict the utility of `multicall`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

LMPVaultRouterBase inherits Multicall implementation forked from Uniswap V3. Uni's multicall is `payable` and it arises an obvious issue of "msg.value in a loop", which in Uniswap's contracts is resolved by:

1. Using `address(this).balance` (instead of `msg.value`) for native-token operations.
2. Adding `payable` to every function that is expected to be multicalled - to prevent these functions from reverting on the `require(msg.value == 0)` check that every non-payable function has under the hood.

## Impact
Tokemak's implementation lacks both of the aforementioned mitigations:
1. LMPVaultRouterBase#withdraw and #redeem do not use `payable` modifier. 
2. LMPVaultRouterBase#_processEthIn relies on `msg.value`. 

With `msg.value > 0`, attempts to `multicall` non-payable `withdraw`/`redeem` together with payable `deposit`/`mint` will revert. Multicalls that have more than one `deposit` or `mint` in total will also revert. 

Examples:

Multicall A (msg.value == 1e18):

1. `deposit` - succeeds.
2. `withdraw` - reverts because the function is not payable and `msg.value > 0`.

Multicall B (msg.value == 1e18):

1. `mint` - succeeds.
2. `deposit` - reverts in line 120, because `msg.value` has already been used by the `mint`:

           weth9.deposit{ value: msg.value }();

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Add `payable` modifier to LMPVaultRouterBase#redeem and #withdraw.

2. Change `msg.value` to `address(this).balance` in _processEthIn:
```diff
    function _processEthIn(ILMPVault vault) internal {
        // if any eth sent, wrap it first
-       if (msg.value > 0) {
+       if (address(this).balance > 0) {
            // if asset is not weth, revert
            if (address(vault.asset()) != address(weth9)) {
                revert InvalidAsset();
            }

            // wrap eth
-           weth9.deposit{ value: msg.value }();
+           weth9.deposit{ value: address(this).balance }();
        }
    }
```
