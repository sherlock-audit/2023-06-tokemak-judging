# The mint fee generated shares are not taken into account when updating navPerShareHighMark.
## Summary
The mint fee generated shares are not taken into account when updating `navPerShareHighMark`.

The actual `navPerShareHighMark` is higher than the expected value, resulting in some instinctively incurred fees being unable to be collected.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `_collectFee`, the `currentNavPerShare` is used to update `navPerShareHighMark`. `currentNavPerShare` is calculated with `((idle + debt) * MAX_FEE_BPS) / totalSupply;`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L800-L832
```solidity
        uint256 currentNavPerShare = ((idle + debt) * MAX_FEE_BPS) / totalSupply;
        uint256 effectiveNavPerShareHighMark = navPerShareHighMark;

        if (currentNavPerShare > effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) {
            // Even if we aren't going to take the fee (haven't set a sink)
            // We still want to calculate so we can emit for off-chain analysis
            profit = (currentNavPerShare - effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) * totalSupply;
            fees = profit.mulDiv(performanceFeeBps, (MAX_FEE_BPS ** 2), Math.Rounding.Up);
            if (fees > 0 && sink != address(0)) {
                // Calculated separate from other mints as normal share mint is round down
                shares = _convertToShares(fees, Math.Rounding.Up);
                _mint(sink, shares);
                emit Deposit(address(this), sink, fees, shares);
            }
            // Set our new high water mark, the last nav/share height we took fees
            navPerShareHighMark = currentNavPerShare;
            navPerShareHighMarkTimestamp = block.timestamp;
            emit NewNavHighWatermark(currentNavPerShare, block.timestamp);
        }
```

If there are any fees incurred, `_mint(sink, shares);` will be executed, which will increase the `totalSupply`. However, the `currentNavPerShare` recorded for updating `navPerShareHighMark` will still be based on the previous `totalSupply`.

## Impact
The actual `navPerShareHighMark` is higher than the expected value, resulting in some instinctively incurred fees being unable to be collected.
