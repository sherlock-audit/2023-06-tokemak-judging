# Some functions of the LMPVault.sol are not comply with the EIP-4626 standard.
## Summary
LMPVault.sol should comply with the EIP4626 standard but it's not. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Non-compliant EIP4626 functions are listed below along with the reason they are not compliant:
(All official EIP-4626 requirements can be found on [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626#methods).)

## Impact
Other protocols that integrate with Tokemak may wrongly assume that the functions are EIP-4626 compliant. Thus, it might cause integration problems in the future that can lead to wide range of issues for both parties.
