# Business Logic Bug in setRewarder() function can introduce covert bugs in LMPVault.sol
## Summary

The business logic behind setRewarder function is that this function should only be used once by the authorized person.
But there is no checks to stop triggering setRewarder again and again. As a result, an authorized person can accidentally trigger this function again which can introduce covert bugs in LMPVault.sol contract

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
 /// @notice Set the rewarder contract used by the vault
    /// @dev Must be set immediately on initialization/creation and only once
    function setRewarder(address _rewarder) external {
        if (msg.sender != factory) {
            revert Errors.AccessDenied();
        }

        Errors.verifyNotZero(_rewarder, "rewarder");

        if (address(rewarder) != address(0)) {
            revert RewarderAlreadySet();
        }

        rewarder = IMainRewarder(_rewarder);

        emit RewarderSet(_rewarder);
    }
```

You can clearly see in developer comments that this functionality is expected to only called once but there is no check to stop getting called it again and again

```solidity
 /// @notice Set the rewarder contract used by the vault
  /// @dev Must be set immediately on initialization/creation and only once
```

## Impact

The intended business logic is breaken which can badly impact the intended working of the LMPVault.sol contract's functionality

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

create a check to prevent this function getting called again
