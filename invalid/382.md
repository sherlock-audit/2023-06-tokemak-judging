# Some underlying could be locked forever in AURA/CONVEX
## Summary

In `BalancerAuraDestinationVault._ensureLocalUnderlyingBalance()`
It takes into consideration the donations made by the team or any user.

```solidity
File: DestinationVault.sol
127:     function internalBalance() public view virtual override returns (uint256) {
128:         return IERC20(_underlying).balanceOf(address(this));
129:     }

```
so anyone could push some `_underlying` tokens to the `DestinationVault`.

From [Docs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/README.md#destination-vaults)
```diff
Destination Vaults mint shares on 1:1 proportion against their underlyer and they're priced in terms of Vault's "base asset".
```
But accepting donations by checking the internal balance with `internalBalance()` will cause negative consequences.

## Vulnerability Detail

when `withdrawUnderlying()` and `withdrawBaseAsset()` are called they will burn the asked amount first, then the sub call to `_ensureLocalUnderlyingBalance()` will adapt the amount of LP tokens ( `_underlying` ) needs to pull it from e.g: AURA, CONVEX. dependence on how much it has in the `internalBalance()`.

Let's say it burns 10 shares. so it should pull 10 LP tokens ( `_underlying` ) from e.g.AURA.
But if `internalBalance()` returns 2, it will only pull 8 LP tokens.
Now we have 0 shares that can be burned in Destination Vaults but still 2 LP tokens AURA.

No one can withdraw these two LPs.

## Impact
- LP (_underlying) could be locked forever in AURA/CONVEX...

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

You should not burn shares in case you withdraw from the donation (internal balance) to keep the 1:1 proportion against their underlying
