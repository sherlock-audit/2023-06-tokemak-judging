# Incorrect Share Burning in Withdrawal Process
## Summary
During the withdrawal process, an issue exists where a user's shares might be incorrectly burned, causing the user to receive zero shares even when they have set an allowance for withdrawal. This issue arises due to the sequence of operations within the `_withdraw` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_withdraw` function processes withdrawals by calculating the withdrawal amount and handling shares burning. However, an oversight in the code logic can result in shares being burned even when the user's intention was to withdraw shares within an established allowance.
```solidity
// do the actual withdrawal (going off of total # requested)
uint256 allowed = allowance(owner, msg.sender);
if (msg.sender != owner && allowed != type(uint256).max) {
    if (shares > allowed) revert AmountExceedsAllowance(shares, allowed);

    unchecked {
        _approve(owner, msg.sender, allowed - shares); //TODO: SafeApprove???
    }
}

_burn(owner, shares);

emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, returnedAssets, shares);

_baseAsset.safeTransfer(receiver, returnedAssets);

return returnedAssets;

```
In the above code, the allowance check is performed before `_burn(owner, shares)` is executed. If the allowance is exceeded, the transaction reverts, and shares are burned before the owner's intention is fulfilled. Consequently, the owner receives zero shares despite setting a withdrawal allowance.
## Impact
Users might end up with zero shares even though they should have received a portion based on their allowance.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, the `_withdraw` function should prioritize the allowance check before proceeding with shares burning. By reordering the sequence of operations, the contract can ensure that shares are only burned if the withdrawal amount is within the user's allowance.
```solidity
uint256 allowed = allowance(owner, msg.sender);
if (msg.sender != owner && allowed != type(uint256).max) {
    if (shares > allowed) revert AmountExceedsAllowance(shares, allowed);

    unchecked {
        _approve(owner, msg.sender, allowed - shares); //TODO: SafeApprove???
    }
    // Emit Withdraw event before burning shares
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, returnedAssets, shares);
    
    _burn(owner, shares);

    _baseAsset.safeTransfer(receiver, returnedAssets);

    return returnedAssets;
}
```
By placing the emission of the `Withdraw` event before the shares burning operation, the revised code ensures that shares are burned only if the withdrawal amount is within the user's allowance. This change prevents the unintended scenario where users receive zero shares despite intending to withdraw within their allowance.
