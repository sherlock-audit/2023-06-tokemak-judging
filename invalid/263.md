# swap function in BalancerV2Swap.sol may revert
## Summary
swap function in BalancerV2Swap.sol may revert

## Vulnerability Detail
If the user would like to deposit into the vault using an asset other than WETH, they should call swapAndDeposit(). The BalancerV2Swap adapter has a swap function that is meant to be used by the router. It may revert if the user intends to use USDT or another token for depositing. The swap function might not consume the full allowance. In such cases, the safeApprove function will revert, as you can use this function only when:

“// safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
// or when resetting it to zero."

## Impact
If the existing allowance is non-zero, then safeApprove() will revert causing the user’s token deposits to fail leading to denial-of-service.
