# Possible transaction revertion due to division by zero when calculating the ratio of total assets to total liabilities
## Summary
The `FrxBeaconChainBacking` contract contains a division by zero vulnerability that can lead to runtime errors when calculating the ratio of total assets to total liabilities. If `totalLiabilities` is zero, the division operation in the `update` function can cause the contract to revert unexpectedly.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is present in the update function of the `FrxBeaconChainBacking` contract, specifically in the division operation `totalAssets * decimalPad / totalLiabilities`. If `totalLiabilities` is zero, the division by zero issue arises, causing the contract execution to fail and revert.
```solidity
function update(
    uint208 totalAssets,
    uint208 totalLiabilities,
    uint48 queriedTimestamp
) public hasRole(Roles.LSD_BACKING_UPDATER) {
    // ...
    
    uint208 ratio = totalAssets * decimalPad / totalLiabilities;
    currentRatio = Ratio(ratio, queriedTimestamp);

    // ...
}
```
## Impact
The entire transaction will be reverted, and any changes made up to that point will be discarded.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Checking whether `totalLiabilities` is zero before performing the division operation, the contract can gracefully handle this scenario.
