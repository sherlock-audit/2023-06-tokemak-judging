# Incorrect calculation of totalAssets from the vault
## Summary  (make the full explanation counting GLIF)
Incorrect calculation of totalAssets from the vault

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling the `totalAssets()` function. The total assets are not calculated correctly. The total assets should be the sum of the `totalIdle` and `totalDebt` - the fees of the protocol to the sink. However, the function returns the `totalIdle` + `totalDebt`.

In this case, the fees are not substracted from the total assets causing a wrong calculation of the `totalAssets()` in the contract by also counting the protocol the fees.

```solidity
function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) { 
        return totalIdle + totalDebt;   
    }

```
## Impact
Users will get wrong conversions to assets and to shares due to an incorrect calculation of the `totalAssets()` in the contract
```soldity
shares = (assets == 0 || supply == 0) ? assets : assets.mulDiv(supply, totalAssets(), rounding);
```

## Recommendation
Do not count the fees as totalAssets()
