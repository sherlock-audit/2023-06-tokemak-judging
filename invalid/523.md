# Omission of _verifySystemsAgree in setLMPVaultRouter function may lead to unexpected behavior
## Summary

The **`SystemRegistry::setLMPVaultRouter()`** omits the call to the **`_verifySystemsAgree()`** function, which is designed to ensure that the contract being set matches the expected system configuration. This omission could lead to misconfigured contracts being set as the **`LMPVaultRouter`**, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the system.

## Vulnerability Detail

**`_verifySystemsAgree()`** verifies that a system bound contract matches this contract, it is called whenever a system contract is being initialized, except on the **`setLMPVaultRouter()`** function.

```solidity
    function setLMPVaultRouter(address router) external onlyOwner {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(router, "lmpVaultRouter");

        _lmpVaultRouter = ILMPVaultRouter(router);

        emit LMPVaultRouterSet(router);
    }
```

This omission means that the **`LMPVaultRouter`** contract being set is not verified against the expected system instance.

*A coded PoC to demonstrate the issue:*

```solidity
    function testSetLMPVaultRouterWithDifferentRegistry() public {

        SystemRegistry invalidRegistry;
        LMPVaultRouter router;

        invalidRegistry = new SystemRegistry(address(1), address(2));

        router = new LMPVaultRouter(invalidRegistry, address(2));

        _systemRegistry.setLMPVaultRouter(address(router));

    }
```

*Result:*

```solidity
[PASS] testSetLMPVaultRouterWithDifferentRegistry() (gas: 3204715)
```

*Test Setup:*

Paste the tests in **`SystemRegistryTest`** contract and add this import:

- `import { LMPVaultRouter } from "src/vault/LMPVaultRouter.sol";`
- `cd v2-core-audit-2023-07-14`
- `forge test --match-contract SystemRegistryTest --match-test testSetLMPVaultRouterWithDifferentRegistry`

## Impact

The omission of the **`_verifySystemsAgree()`** verification step in the **`setLMPVaultRouter()`** function could have several adverse impacts:

- The **`LMPVaultRouter`** contract may not receive the expected configuration, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

- The absence of verification allows the potential deployment of misconfigured contracts as the **`LMPVaultRouter`**, bypassing security checks and making external calls to untrusted contract:

```solidity
systemRegistry.asyncSwapperRegistry().verifyIsRegistered(swapper);
```

- Without verification, the system might end up with inconsistent configurations, resulting in unpredictable interactions between system components.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend adding this function to the [**`LMPVaultRouter`**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouter.sol#L14) contract: 

```solidity
    function getSystemRegistry() external view returns (address) {
        return address(systemRegistry);
    }
```

Then, update the **`setLMPVaultRouter()`** as follow:

```solidity
    function setLMPVaultRouter(address router) external onlyOwner {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(router, "lmpVaultRouter");

        emit LMPVaultRouterSet(router);

        _lmpVaultRouter = ILMPVaultRouter(router);
        _verifySystemsAgree(router);
    }
```

Tests will fail after the fix: 

```solidity
[FAIL. Reason: SystemMismatch(0x5615dEB798BB3E4dFa0139dFa1b3D433Cc23b72f, 0x2e234DAe75C793f67A35089C9d99245E1C58470b)]
