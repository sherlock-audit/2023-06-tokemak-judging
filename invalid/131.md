# ChainlinkOracle will return the wrong price for asset if underlying aggregator hits minAnswer
## Summary
ChainlinkOracle will return the wrong price for asset if underlying aggregator hits minAnswer

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash) the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. This would allow user to continue borrowing with the asset but at the wrong price. This is exactly what happened to [Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).
## Impact
In the event that an asset crashes (i.e. LUNA) the protocol can be manipulated to give out loans at an inflated price

Example:
TokenA has a minPrice of $1. The price of TokenA drops to $0.10. The aggregator still returns $1 allowing the user to borrow against TokenA as if it is $1 which is 10x it's actual value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
ChainlinkOracle should check the returned answer against the minPrice/maxPrice and revert if the answer is outside of the bounds:

        (uint80 roundId, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = chainlinkOracle.oracle.latestRoundData();
    
+   if (price>= maxPrice or price<= minPrice) revert();
