# Incorrect `amountsOut` array due to re-use of array
## Summary

Incorrect `amountsOut` array will be returned due to re-use of the array, causing a revert or an error to the withdrawal process as the actual assets received and the `amountsOut` array are not in sync, affecting the user's ability to withdraw from the vaults.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `amountsOut` array at Line 272 below is being reused.

The ``params.amountsOut`` is the minimum amount of tokens users expect to receive when exiting the pool. Assume the `params.amountsOut` is set to [0 BPT, $x$ WETH, $y$ wstETH] when the function is called. As a result, the `amountsOut` array will be initialized to [0 BPT,  $x$ WETH, $y$ wstETH] at Line 282 below.

Assume that only $z$ WETH is returned when exiting the pool due to a single asset exit. However, as the last element is already initialized to $y$ wstETH, the `amountsOut` returned from the function will be [0 BPT, $z$ WETH, $y$ wstETH], which is incorrect. The correct `amountsOut` should be [0 BPT, $z$ WETH, 0 wstETH] in this case.

## Impact

Incorrect `amountsOut` array will be returned due to re-use of the array, causing a revert or an error to the withdrawal process as the actual assets received and the `amountsOut` array are not in sync, affecting the user's ability to withdraw from the vaults.

## Recommendation

Avoid re-using the array to prevent any potential pitfalls.
