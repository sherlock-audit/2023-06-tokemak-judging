# Relying on the LP token balance decrease to determine the amount burned is prone to major risk
## Summary
The contract assumes the LP token balance decrease matches the amount passed to removeLiquidity. If the LP tokens are manipulated, more could be burned than expected. 
## Vulnerability Detail
It assumes the LP token balance decrease lpTokenAmount matches the amount passed to removeLiquidity.
However, a malicious user could:
• Approve the contract to spend extra LP tokens
• Contract calls removeLiquidity with amount X
• Attacker separately transfers extra LP tokens from the contract
• Causing a larger than expected balance decrease
• So more LP tokens are burned than intended

## Impact
- This could steal funds from the contract by burning more than approved.
- The accounting of LP token balances across the system would be corrupted.

## Recommendation
Rely on the return value from removeLiquidity, not the balance difference
