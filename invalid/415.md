# reentrancy risk due to the use of getDataBefore() in the getPriceInEth() function.
## Summary
The use of getDataBefore() to retrieve Tellor data introduces potential reentrancy risk if that call back into the contract while in an intermediate state.
## Vulnerability Detail 
The getPriceInEth() function first retrieves the Tellor query info for the token being priced [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/TellorOracle.sol#L102). It then calls getDataBefore() to retrieve the latest price data from Tellor [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/TellorOracle.sol#L105 )
The key thing here is that getDataBefore() makes an external call to the Tellor contract. External calls can be manipulated to execute malicious code before returning.
So an attacker could construct the getDataBefore() call to execute some malicious code that calls back into the TellorOracle contract while it is still in an intermediate state after retrieving the TellorInfo but before completing the price lookup.
For example, the malicious code could call the getPriceInEth() function recursively, providing manipulated data to cause issues. Or it could call other functions in the contract that modify state like adding a new Tellor registration.
This would lead to a reentrancy attack since the contract is callable while still executing its own code path.

## Impact
An attacker could manipulate the callback to call getPriceInEth() recursively, draining funds, manipulate contract logic  or causing other unintended effects before the first call finishes execution.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
the getDataBefore() call should happen before any state changes or after completing the logic.
