# Lack of Validation for Maverick Boosted Position Contract in `getPriceInEth` Function
## Summary
The `getPriceInEth` function within the `MavEthOracle` contract lacks proper validation for the input address `_boostedPosition`, potentially allowing any address to be passed. This can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior, as the function attempts to cast the address to the `IPoolPositionDynamicSlim` interface without verifying whether the address corresponds to a valid Maverick boosted position contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerable code segment is within the getPriceInEth function:
```solidity
IPoolPositionDynamicSlim boostedPosition = IPoolPositionDynamicSlim(_boostedPosition);
```
The issue arises because there is no check to ensure that `_boostedPosition` is a valid Maverick boosted position contract address. As a result, any address can be supplied, and the cast to the `IPoolPositionDynamicSlim` interface may fail at runtime if the address does not implement the expected interface.
## Impact
If an incorrect address is provided, the contract will not function as intended and transactions interacting with the getPriceInEth function may fail, causing inconvenience for users and potential financial losses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A simple validation check could involve verifying that the supplied address is a valid Maverick boosted position contract address. An example mitigation code snippet is as follows:
```solidity
// Verify that the provided address is a valid Maverick boosted position contract
require(isValidMaverickBoostedPosition(_boostedPosition), "Invalid boosted position address");

// Cast the address to the IPoolPositionDynamicSlim interface
IPoolPositionDynamicSlim boostedPosition = IPoolPositionDynamicSlim(_boostedPosition);
```
