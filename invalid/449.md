# Unconventional Token Pairing  in CurveV2CryptoEthOracle
## Summary

- The `getPriceInEth` function calculates the price of a token in terms of ETH by using information from the lpTokenToPool mapping. The code fetches the PoolData associated with the provided token and uses the virtual price of the Curve pool to calculate the token's value in ETH., the problem  in the assumption that the second token (tokens[1]) in the Curve pool's coins array is always the token paired with Ethereum. While this assumption may be true for most Curve pools, it's not a universal rule. There are cases where Ethereum is not the second token in the pair.

```solidity
    function getPriceInEth(address token) external returns (uint256 price) {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(token, "token");

        PoolData memory poolInfo = lpTokenToPool[token];
        if (poolInfo.pool == address(0)) revert NotRegistered(token);

        ICryptoSwapPool cryptoPool = ICryptoSwapPool(poolInfo.pool);

        // Checking for read only reentrancy scenario.
        if (poolInfo.checkReentrancy == 1) {
            // This will fail in a reentrancy situation.
            cryptoPool.claim_admin_fees();
        }

        uint256 virtualPrice = cryptoPool.get_virtual_price();
        uint256 assetPrice = systemRegistry.rootPriceOracle().getPriceInEth(poolInfo.tokenToPrice);

        return (2 * virtualPrice * sqrt(assetPrice)) / 10 ** 18;
    }

```
- If `poolInfo.tokenToPrice` is not the token paired with Ethereum in the Curve pool, the resulting `assetPrice` value will be incorrect, leading to inaccurate price calculations.
-  The assumption made in the code is that the second token `(tokens[1])` in the Curve pool's coins array is always the token paired with Ethereum (ETH). This assumption may hold true for most Curve pools, but it's not guaranteed to be accurate in all cases.
- a malicious actor registers a Curve pool with an unconventional token pairing that intentionally violates the assumption. as an examlpe the pool configuration can be as:
    - Token A (DAI)
    - Token B (USDC)
    - Token C (ETH)
In this scenario, Token C (ETH) is not the second token in the coins array.
- When the getPriceInEth function is called for Token A, the vulnerable line of code will fetch `poolInfo.tokenToPrice,` which is expected to be Token C (ETH), due to the unconventional pairing set by the malicious actor, `poolInfo.tokenToPrice` will be Token B (USDC) instead.
- The calculation of `assetPrice` using `systemRegistry.rootPriceOracle().getPriceInEth(poolInfo.tokenToPrice)` will result in fetching the price of Token B (USDC) instead of Token C (ETH). This will lead to incorrect pricing calculations, as the function will incorrectly assume that Token B (USDC) is paired with ETH.
- incorrect Pricing Calculation Since the pricing assumption is incorrect, the calculations of token value in ETH will be inaccurate. The final calculated price will not accurately represent the true value of Token A in terms of ETH.
- and here an Real Example:
Let's say a legitimate Curve pool configuration is as follows:
    Token A: DAI
    Token B: USDC
    Token C: ETH
Now, the malicious actor deploys a Curve pool with the following unconventional configuration:
    Token X: DAI
    Token Y: ETH
    Token Z: USDC
When the getPriceInEth function is called for Token X in the maliciously deployed pool, the code will assume that Token Y (ETH) is paired with ETH. However, in this unconventional pool, Token Z (USDC) is actually paired with ETH.
This will result in fetching the price of USDC (Token Z) instead of ETH (Token Y), leading to incorrect pricing calculations for Token X, and affecting any other parts of the system that rely on accurate Token X pricing.

## Impact

If a malicious actor registers a Curve pool with an unconventional token pairing that doesn't follow the assumption made in the code, the calculations in the `getPriceInEth` function will produce incorrect results. This can lead to incorrect pricing calculations, potentially affecting other parts of the system that rely on accurate token pricing
