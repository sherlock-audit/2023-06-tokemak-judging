# No `minAnswer/maxAnswer` Circuit Breaker Checks while Querying Prices in ChainlinkOracle.sol
## Summary

There should be an implementation in the ChainlinkOracle.sol contract to ensure the returned prices are not at the extreme boundaries (minAnswer and maxAnswer). Without such a mechanism, the contract could operate based on incorrect prices, which could lead to an over- or under-representation of the asset's value, potentially causing significant harm to the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash) the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. This would allow user to continue borrowing with the asset but at the wrong price. This is exactly what happened to [Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/). In its current form, the getUnderlyingPrice() function within the Oracle.sol contract retrieves the latest round data from Chainlink, if the asset's market price plummets below minAnswer or skyrockets above maxAnswer, the returned price will still be minAnswer or maxAnswer, respectively, rather than the actual market price. This could potentially lead to an exploitation scenario where the protocol interacts with the asset using incorrect price information.

```solidity
    function getPriceInEth(address token) external returns (uint256) {
        ChainlinkInfo memory chainlinkOracle = _getChainlinkInfo(token);


        // Partial return values are intentionally ignored. This call provides the most efficient way to get the data.
        // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
        (uint80 roundId, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = chainlinkOracle.oracle.latestRoundData();
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint256 oracleStoredTimeout = uint256(chainlinkOracle.pricingTimeout);
        uint256 tokenPricingTimeout = oracleStoredTimeout == 0 ? DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT : oracleStoredTimeout;
        if (
            roundId == 0 || price <= 0 || updatedAt == 0 || updatedAt > timestamp
                || updatedAt < timestamp - tokenPricingTimeout
        ) revert InvalidDataReturned();


        uint256 decimals = chainlinkOracle.decimals;
        // Checked to be > 0 above.
        uint256 priceUint = uint256(price);
        // Chainlink feeds have certain decimal precisions, does not neccessarily conform to underlying asset.
        uint256 normalizedPrice = decimals == 18 ? priceUint : priceUint * 10 ** (18 - decimals);


        return _denominationPricing(chainlinkOracle.denomination, normalizedPrice, token);
    }
```

Illustration:
- Present price of TokenA is $10
- TokenA has a minimum price set at $1 on chainlink
- The actual price of TokenA dips to $0.10
- The aggregator continues to report $1 as the price.
Consequently, users can interact with protocol using TokenA as though it were still valued at $1, which is a tenfold overestimate of its real market value.

## Impact

The potential for misuse arises when the actual price of an asset drastically changes but the oracle continues to operate using the minAnswer or maxAnswer as the asset's price. In the case of it going under the minAnswer malicious actors obviously have the upperhand and could give their potential going to zero worth tokens to protocol

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Since there is going to be a whitelist of tokens to be added, the minPrice/maxPrice could be checked and a revert could be made when this is returned by chainlink or a fallback oracle that does not have circuit breakers could be implemented in that case
