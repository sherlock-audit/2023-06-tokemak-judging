# Destination vaults are vulnerable to donation attacks by direct transfer of underlying LP tokens
## Summary

The destination vaults are vulnerable to donation attacks, which allow malicious users to inflate the debt value of the DVs by directly transferring underlying LP tokens to the DV.

## Vulnerability Detail

When computing the total debt value, the destination vault relies on the spot balance of the underlying LP tokens residing on the DV. As such, anyone could perform a donation attack by transferring over the LP tokens to the DV, thus inflating the total debt value of the DV.

```solidity
File: DestinationVault.sol
122:     function balanceOfUnderlying() public view virtual override returns (uint256) {
123:         return internalBalance() + externalBalance();
124:     }
125: 
126:     /// @inheritdoc IDestinationVault
127:     function internalBalance() public view virtual override returns (uint256) {
128:         return IERC20(_underlying).balanceOf(address(this));
129:     }
..SNIP..
145:     function debtValue() public virtual override returns (uint256 value) {
146:         value = _debtValue(balanceOfUnderlying());
147:     }
```

## Impact

Any internal or external parties that rely on the debt value of a destination vault to make financial decisions will be impacted. 

For instance, it was understood from the protocol team that the total debt value of a DV will be used when trimming the DVs when certain violations occur (e.g., assets trading at a discount for a certain period or slashing occur). In this case, debt values that do not accurately reflect the actual number of underlying LP tokens that the LMPVaults have deposited to the DVs will negatively affect the process, which might result in an inaccurate trimming/rebalancing process, leading to potential loss to the vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a variable to keep track of the total underlying LP tokens on the contract instead of using the `balanceOf` method.
