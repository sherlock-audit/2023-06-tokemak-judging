# Adding a DV with diffrent base asset can break the LMPVault functionality
## Summary

The **`addDestinations()`** function does not properly check if the added Destination Vaults (DV) have the same base asset as the LMPVault. This oversight can lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected behavior in the LMPVault functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

***As per of the docs:***

> An Autopilot Vault should track it’s “base asset”. This is the asset that will be deposited and withdrawn from the Vault. Any auto-compounding that happens will be in terms of the base asset, as well. The result of this is that an Autopilot Vault should only accept Destination Vaults in its Strategy that match it’s base asset. However, it is expected that the Autopilot Vaults associated Rewarder can emit any token(s).

However, in the code, the vault allows adding Destination Vaults with a different base asset. Furthermore, it allows adding DVs with base asset decimals that differ from its base asset.

***A codde PoC to demonstrate the issue:***

```solidity
    function testAddDestinationWithDiffrentBaseAsset() public {

        IDestinationVault NewDestinationVault;
        TestERC20 randomAsset;

        randomAsset = new TestERC20("randomAsset", "RA");
        _systemRegistry.addRewardToken(address(randomAsset));
        vm.label(address(randomAsset), "randomAsset");
        randomAsset.setDecimals(30);

        assertEq(randomAsset.decimals(), 30);

        address[] memory additionalTrackedTokens = new address[](0);

        NewDestinationVault = IDestinationVault(
            _destinationVaultFactory.create(
                "template",
                address(randomAsset),
                address(_underlyerOne),
                additionalTrackedTokens,
                keccak256("salt3"),
                abi.encode("")
            )
        );

        vm.label(address(NewDestinationVault), "NewDestinationVault");

        address[] memory destArray = new address[](1);

        destArray[0] = address(NewDestinationVault);

        _lmpVault.addDestinations(destArray);

    }
```

*Result:*

```solidity
Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; finished in 37.18ms
```

*Test Setup:*

- `cd v2-core-audit-2023-07-14`
- `forge test --match-contract LMPVaultMintingTests --match-test testAddDestinationWithDiffrentBaseAsset`

## Impact

***Adding a Destination Vault with a different base asset or a different number of decimals can lead to:***

- The calculations within the LMPVault can go awry. This can result in incorrect amounts of assets being allocated, compounded, or withdrawn.
- The incorrect calculations can lead to users receiving different amounts of rewards or assets than they anticipated. This can potentially result in financial losses for users or the protocol depending on the asset `decimals()` (.i.e more or less than 1e18).
- The LMPVault might start handling assets it wasn't designed to handle. This can lead to the misallocation of assets and compromise the overall strategy of the LMPVault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend adding this check to the **`addDestinations()`** function: 

```solidity
            require(IDestinationVault(dAddress).baseAsset() == ILMPVault(address(this)).asset(), "Dest.baseAsset != asset");
```

And add this import to [**`LMPDestinations`**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDestinations.sol#L11):

```solidity
import { ILMPVault } from "src/interfaces/vault/ILMPVault.sol";
```

The tests will fails after the fix: 

```solidity
[FAIL. Reason: Dest.baseAsset != asset] testAddDestinationWithDiffrentBaseAsset() (gas: 3090008)
```
