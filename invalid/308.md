# If the startEpoch is > than block.timestamp then the unstaking won't be done at the correct time.
## Summary
If the startEpoch is > than block.timestamp then the unstaking won't be done at the correct time.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can stake by calling the stake function in the gpToke contract: 

```solidity
 function stake(uint256 amount, uint256 duration) external {
        _stake(amount, duration, msg.sender); 
    }

```

Stake, calls the `previewPoints` function, which makes the following calculation for the duration specified by the end user:
```solidity
   uint256 start = block.timestamp > startEpoch ? block.timestamp : startEpoch;
   end = start + duration; 
 ```
If a user sets whatever duration, let's say 90 days, and the `startEpoch` is bigger than the `block.timestamp`, the unstaking period will be different from the one the user wanted. Not allowing the user to unstake when he specified.

## Impact
Users will not be able to unstake for the difference of time between `startEpoch ` and `block.timestamp`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `startEpoch` variable seems completely unnecessary, I would remove it. And if the sponsor wants to keep it, don't let it be bigger than block.timestamp
