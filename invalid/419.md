# block.timestamp used as deadline for swap
## Summary
`block.timestamp` is used as deadline parameter while performing swaps

## Vulnerability Detail
there are 2 swapper adapters, namely `BalancerV2Swap.sol` and `UniV3Swap.sol` where swaps are performed setting the deadline as `block.timestamp`, this is bad form and a common vulnerability that allows MEV bots to withold the swap until they can profit at maximum slippage or more in general it allows miners to arbitrarly choose when to include the tx in a block. more info [here](https://blog.bytes032.xyz/p/why-you-should-stop-using-block-timestamp-as-deadline-in-swaps)
## Impact
loss of funds and unexpected behaviour
