# curve admin can drain pool via reentrancy (equal to execute emergency withdraw and rug tokenmak fund by third party)
## Summary

curve admin can drain pool via reentrancy (equal to execute emergency withdraw and rug tokenmak fund)

## Vulnerability Detail

A few curve liquidity is pool is well in-scope:

```solidity
Curve Pools

Curve stETH/ETH: 0x06325440D014e39736583c165C2963BA99fAf14E
Curve stETH/ETH ng: 0x21E27a5E5513D6e65C4f830167390997aA84843a

one of the pool is 0x21E27a5E5513D6e65C4f830167390997aA84843a

Admin of curve pools can easily drain curve pools via reentrancy or via the `withdraw_admin_fees` function. 

```solidity
@external
def withdraw_admin_fees():
    receiver: address = Factory(self.factory).get_fee_receiver(self)

    amount: uint256 = self.admin_balances[0]
    if amount != 0:
        raw_call(receiver, b"", value=amount)

    amount = self.admin_balances[1]
    if amount != 0:
        assert ERC20(self.coins[1]).transfer(receiver, amount, default_return_value=True)

    self.admin_balances = empty(uint256[N_COINS])
```

if admin of the curve can set a receiver to a malicious smart contract and reenter withdraw_admin_fees a 1000 times to drain the pool even the admin_balances is small

the line of code

```solidty
raw_call(receiver, b"", value=amount)
```

trigger the reentrancy

This is a problem because as stated by the tokemak team:

>> In case of external protocol integrations, are the risks of external contracts pausing or executing an emergency withdrawal acceptable? If not, Watsons will submit issues related to these situations that can harm your protocol's functionality.
> 
> Pausing or emergency withdrawals are not acceptable for Tokemak.

As you can see above, pausing or emergency withdrawals are not acceptable, and this is possible for cuve pools so this is a valid issue according to the protocol and according to the read me

## Impact
