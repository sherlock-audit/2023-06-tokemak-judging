# Rebalancing allows the deposit of underlying LP Tokens to DV during shutdown
## Summary

An LMPVault that has been shut down can still deposit underlying LP tokens to destination vaults.

When the LMPVault is shut down, the vault might have migrated, been compromised by attackers, or was no longer profitable. No further "investment" to the DVs should occur in this case. Continuing to add assets/values to these vaults might lead to further loss of assets.

## Vulnerability Detail

During a shutdown, it does not allow the base asset (WETH) to flow out of the LMPVault. The only operation that is allowed is those that get the base asset (WETH) from the destination vaults back to the LMPVault as per the comment in the code below:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L369

```solidity
File: LMPDebt.sol
369:     function _handleRebalanceOut(
..SNIP..
398:             } else {
399:                 // If we are shutdown then the only operations we should be performing are those that get
400:                 // the base asset back to the vault. We shouldn't be sending out more
401:                 if (params._shutdown) {
402:                     revert VaultShutdown();
403:                 }
404:                 // Working with idle baseAsset which should be in the vault already
405:                 // Just send it out
406:                 IERC20(params.tokenOut).safeTransfer(params.receiver, params.amountOut);
407:                 assetChange.idleDecrease = params.amountOut;
408:             }
409:         }
410:     }
```

However, it was observed that it is still possible to deposit the underlying (LP token) from LMPVault to destination vaults during a rebalance, which breaks the invariant.

```solidity
File: LMPDebt.sol
67:     function rebalance(
..SNIP..
110:         // Handle increase (shares coming "In", getting underlying from the swapper and trading for new shares)
111:         if (params.amountIn > 0) {
112:             // transfer dv underlying lp from swapper to here
113:             IERC20(params.tokenIn).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), params.amountIn);
114: 
115:             // deposit to dv (already checked in `verifyRebalance` so no need to check return of deposit)
116: 
117:             if (params.tokenIn != address(baseAsset)) {
118:                 IDestinationVault dvIn = IDestinationVault(params.destinationIn);
119:                 (uint256 debtDecreaseIn, uint256 debtIncreaseIn) =
120:                     _handleRebalanceIn(destInfoIn, dvIn, params.tokenIn, params.amountIn);
121:                 idleDebtChange.debtDecrease += debtDecreaseIn;
122:                 idleDebtChange.debtIncrease += debtIncreaseIn;
123:             } else {
124:                 idleDebtChange.idleIncrease += params.amountIn;
125:             }
126:         }
```

## Impact

When the LMPVault is shut down, the vault might have migrated, been compromised by attackers, or was no longer profitable. No further "investment" to the DVs should occur in this case. Continuing to add assets/values to these vaults might lead to further loss of assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider preventing the deposit of underlying (LP Tokens) to destination vaults during a shutdown.

```diff
if (params.tokenIn != address(baseAsset)) {
+	if (params._shutdown) {
+		revert VaultShutdown();
+	}
    IDestinationVault dvIn = IDestinationVault(params.destinationIn);
    (uint256 debtDecreaseIn, uint256 debtIncreaseIn) =
        _handleRebalanceIn(destInfoIn, dvIn, params.tokenIn, params.amountIn);
    idleDebtChange.debtDecrease += debtDecreaseIn;
    idleDebtChange.debtIncrease += debtIncreaseIn;
} else {
    idleDebtChange.idleIncrease += params.amountIn;
}
```
