# Predictable Snapshot Timing Vulnerable to Price Manipulation via Mempool Observations
## Summary
Predictable Snapshot Timing Vulnerable to Price Manipulation via Mempool Observations

## Vulnerability Detail
The IncentivePricingStats contract is integral to the protocol, responsible for post-processing to derive a robust incentive pricing estimate for the LMP. This estimate subsequently determines the incentive APR in ETH units. The contract employs dual filters, termed 'slow' and 'fast', with the final incentive price being a fusion of both.

Snapshots, crucial for price determination, are taken at intervals that, although randomized, are triggered by an external cronjob. This design, combined with the OnlyStatsSnapshot modifier, ensures that only specific roles can initiate these snapshots. However, a significant vulnerability arises from the transparency of transaction mempools. Malicious entities, by observing the mempool, can anticipate an imminent snapshot and strategically manipulate prices. Notably, the existing safeguards are ill-equipped to counter genuine price actions, amplifying the risk.

## Impact
Medium: The predictability can lead to skewed incentive pricing, potentially causing financial discrepancies and undermining user trust.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enhance Snapshot Unpredictability: To robustly counteract front-running attacks, it's imperative to obscure snapshot timings. One potent solution is the integration of relays, such as Flashbots. By bypassing the public mempool, these relays render it exceedingly difficult for adversaries to foresee and exploit snapshot timings, thereby preserving the integrity of incentive pricing.
