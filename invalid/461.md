# Destination Vaults can lose funds due to lack of slippage protection
## Summary
When destination vaults swap tokens, there is no slippage protection. Due to that, vaults can spend more tokens and lose funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
If there are not enough idle funds in the LMPVault, the rest of the funds are withdrawn from Destination Vaults.
```solidity
uint256 withdrawalQueueLength = withdrawalQueue.length;
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawalQueueLength; ++i) {
                IDestinationVault destVault = IDestinationVault(withdrawalQueue[i]);
                (uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) = _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
                    destVault,
                    shares,
                    info.totalAssetsToPull - Math.max(info.debtDecrease, info.totalAssetsPulled),
                    totalVaultShares
                );
                if (sharesToBurn == 0) {
                    continue;
                }

                uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
                uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));
```
If one destination vault is not enough, funds are withdrawn from other destination vaults as well. [This for loop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L470-L505) ends if there are no remaining destination vaults or when the totalAssetsPulled is equal to the totalAssetsToPull.
```solidity
if (token == _baseAsset) {
                amount += amounts[i];
            } else {
                if (amounts[i] > 0) {
                    IERC20(token).safeApprove(address(swapRouter), amounts[i]);
                    amount += swapRouter.swapForQuote(token, amounts[i], _baseAsset, 0); 
                }
            }
```
If [tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L255-L257) are not  _baseAsset, tokens will be swapped to _baseAsset.
The problem is that there is no slippage protection on these swaps.
For Example :
Let's say there are [3 destination vaults](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L469-L471).
The first two vaults have enough funds to cover totalAssetsToPull, but due to slippage, these vaults may not cover the funds, and the third vault needs to cover the remaining. As a result, the vaults end up spending more funds.

## Impact
Due to slippage, vaults can spend more funds than they should.
