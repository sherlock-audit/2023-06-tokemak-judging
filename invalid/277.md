# No Check If L2 Sequencer is Down in Chainlink Feeds
## Summary
Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum requires to check if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.

The bug could be leveraged by malicious actors to take advantage of the sequencer downtime.
## Vulnerability Detail
The **ChainlinkOracle.getPriceInEth()** is used to get price but there is no check if the L2 sequencer is down.

## Impact
The price returned by **ChainlinkOracle.getPriceInEth()** will be inaccurate since the true price won't be reported if the sequencer is down. This could lead to users/protocol being reported an outdated price.
## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function getPriceInEth(address token) external returns (uint256) {
        ChainlinkInfo memory chainlinkOracle = _getChainlinkInfo(token);

        // Partial return values are intentionally ignored. This call provides the most efficient way to get the data.
        // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
        (uint80 roundId, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = chainlinkOracle.oracle.latestRoundData();
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint256 oracleStoredTimeout = uint256(chainlinkOracle.pricingTimeout);
        uint256 tokenPricingTimeout = oracleStoredTimeout == 0 ? DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT : oracleStoredTimeout;
        if (
            roundId == 0 || price <= 0 || updatedAt == 0 || updatedAt > timestamp
                || updatedAt < timestamp - tokenPricingTimeout
        ) revert InvalidDataReturned();

        uint256 decimals = chainlinkOracle.decimals;
        // Checked to be > 0 above.
        uint256 priceUint = uint256(price);
        // Chainlink feeds have certain decimal precisions, does not neccessarily conform to underlying asset.
        uint256 normalizedPrice = decimals == 18 ? priceUint : priceUint * 10 ** (18 - decimals);

        return _denominationPricing(chainlinkOracle.denomination, normalizedPrice, token);
    }
