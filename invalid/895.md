# LMPVault : The vault does not allow to withdraw when the vault is passed.
## Summary

When we look at the `LMPVault` implementation, it has `pause/unpause` mechanism which will be used in emergency situation.

while this pause the deposit but it also pause the withdraw of an user.

## Vulnerability Detail

whenever a user interact with vault to deposit and withdraw, the common function which in called is [_maxMint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L921). This function returns 0 if the vault is paused or shutdown.

It is fine to pause for deposit in order to avoid any unnecessary dumping of low value assets .( listed address could go low in value).

But, for withdraw also, this function returns zero. This will affect the users to withdraw the funds. In most of the ERC20 vault based implementation, pause is not applied for withdraw/redeem.

## Impact

user could not be able to withdraw their assets which is not appropriate.
