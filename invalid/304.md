# Missing to check that staking points were exceeded when extending the staking period
## Summary
Missing to check that staking points were exceeded when extending the staking period

## Vulnerability Detail
When staking tokens by calling `stake()` there is a check that the staking points are not exceeded. 

```solidity
   (uint256 points, uint256 end) = previewPoints(amount, duration);

        if (points + totalSupply() > type(uint192).max) {
            revert StakingPointsExceeded();
        }
```
However, when extending the staking period by calling `extend()` there is no check that the staking points are not exceeded. Therefore, an attacker could stake a lot of tokens and then extend the staking period to get above the max staking points.

Missing code in `extend()`:
```solidity
   if (points + totalSupply() > type(uint192).max) {
            revert StakingPointsExceeded();
        }
```

## Impact
Breaking one of the protocol invariants, (You should never exceed the maximum amount of points), which will push the protocol to an undesired state

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the following check to extend():

```solidity
   if (points + totalSupply() > type(uint192).max) {
            revert StakingPointsExceeded();
        }
```
