# Potential Sandwich Attack Due to block.timestamp as Deadline in swap Function
## Summary
The `swap` function in the smart contract uses `block.timestamp` as the deadline for the swap. This design choice allows the validator (or miner) to potentially manipulate the timestamp, giving them the ability to delay the transaction and exploit profitable sandwich attack opportunities.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the use of `block.timestamp` as the deadline in the `swap` function. Since `block.timestamp` can be influenced by the validator to some extent (within a reasonable range), they can intentionally delay the transaction to find a moment when the market conditions are favorable for a sandwich attack. In a sandwich attack, a malicious actor can place a transaction before and after the victim's transaction to profit from price slippages.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace the hardcoded `block.timestamp` deadline with a user-specified deadline parameter in the swap function. By allowing users to specify their own deadline, you can reduce the potential for manipulation by validators.
