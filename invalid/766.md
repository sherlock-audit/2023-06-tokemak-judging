# ChainlinkOracle.sol doesn't check minAnswer, hence it can return wrong price
## Summary
Chainlink Oracles has minAnswer and maxAnswer values. If price drops below this(minAnswer) threshold, Oracle will continue to return minPrice instead of current price(same is relevant for maxAnswer). Hence wrong price will be used.
## Vulnerability Detail
[Chainlink Docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits):
> The data feed aggregator includes both [minAnswer and maxAnswer values](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/libocr/blob/9e4afd8896f365b964bdf769ca28f373a3fb0300/contract/AccessControlledOffchainAggregator.sol#L33). These variables prevent the aggregator from updating the latestAnswer outside the agreed range of acceptable values, but they do not stop your application from reading the most recent answer.
> Configure your application to detect when the reported answer is close to reaching minAnswer or maxAnswer and issue an alert so you can respond to a potential market event. Separately, configure your application to detect and respond to extreme price volatility or prices that are outside of your acceptable limits.

Tokemak gets chainlink prices as follows:
```solidity
function getPriceInEth(address token) external returns (uint256) {
        ChainlinkInfo memory chainlinkOracle = _getChainlinkInfo(token);

        // Partial return values are intentionally ignored. This call provides the most efficient way to get the data.
        // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
        (uint80 roundId, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = chainlinkOracle.oracle.latestRoundData();
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint256 oracleStoredTimeout = uint256(chainlinkOracle.pricingTimeout);
        uint256 tokenPricingTimeout = oracleStoredTimeout == 0 ? DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT : oracleStoredTimeout;
        if (
            roundId == 0 || price <= 0 || updatedAt == 0 || updatedAt > timestamp
                || updatedAt < timestamp - tokenPricingTimeout
        ) revert InvalidDataReturned();
```
As we can see, price is checked against 0 and if it is 0 or below, it will revert. But in case of oracle price drops below minAnswer, per Chainlink Docs, oracle will continue to return minAnswer. In these cases it is important to check price against min and max values instead of "0" and if price hits these values, it is important to revert in order to not use wrong prices.

## Impact
In case of price goes out of range, protocol will return wrong price.

## Recommendation
Instead of checking the price against 0, check it against minAnswer and maxAnswer as shown below:
```solidity
if (
roundId == 0 || price <= minAnswer || price >= maxAnswer || updatedAt == 0 
 || updatedAt > timestamp || updatedAt < timestamp - tokenPricingTimeout
        ) revert InvalidDataReturned();
```
