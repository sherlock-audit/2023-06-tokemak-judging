# asui - external or public functions in peripheryPayments.sol
## Summary
since the ```solidity PeripheryPayments.sol ``` is inherited by the ```solidity LMPVault.sol ``` make some of the functions in the PeripheryPayments contract internal or proper access control. 

## Vulnerability Detail
lets look at the unweapWETH9 function where someone could get eth if the router have weth9:
```solidity
// the vaultRouter might have some tokens say10 weth9
function unwrapWETH9(uint256 amountMinimum, address recipient) public payable { // public so anyone can call this function with (0, myAddress)
        uint256 balanceWETH9 = weth9.balanceOf(address(this)); // balanceWETH9 = 10 

        if (balanceWETH9 < amountMinimum) revert InsufficientWETH9(); // 10 < 0 is false so continue

        if (balanceWETH9 > 0) { // 10 > 0 is true
            weth9.withdraw(balanceWETH9); // this unwraps the weth9 to eth = 10eth
            Address.sendValue(payable(recipient), balanceWETH9); // sends the 10 eth to myAddress
        }
    }
```
the wrapWETH9 can also be made internal or give proper access control so that not everybody can wrap the balance of the contract : 
```solidity
function wrapWETH9() public payable {
        if (address(this).balance > 0) weth9.deposit{ value: address(this).balance }(); // wrap everything
    }
```
pullToken function can also be made internal to avoid unnecessary issues : 
```solidity
 function pullToken(IERC20 token, uint256 amount, address recipient) public payable {
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
```
in the sweepToken function if any ERC20 type of token is held by the router anyone can take it : 
```solidity
function sweepToken(IERC20 token, uint256 amountMinimum, address recipient) public payable { // someone calls this function with (token address, 0, 0x....)
        uint256 balanceToken = token.balanceOf(address(this)); // balanceToken = 10
        if (balanceToken < amountMinimum) revert InsufficientToken(); // 10 < 0 is false so continue

        if (balanceToken > 0) { // 10 > 0 is true so continue
            token.safeTransfer(recipient, balanceToken); // transfer 10 tokens to 0x....
        }
    }
```
in the refundETH function anyone can withdraw the eth balance of the contract : 
```solidity
function refundETH() external payable {
        if (address(this).balance > 0) Address.sendValue(payable(msg.sender), address(this).balance);
    }
```
instead of mkaing everyone to call refundETH if someone sends ether to this contract by mistake store their address with the amount of eth and when refundETH is called send back only their respective eth.

## Impact
since all the function in this contract a either public or external with no proper access control users might make mistake or someone could take all the funds(if any) held by the LMPVaultRouter since peripheryPayments is inherited by the vaultRouterBase which is inherited by the LMPVaultRouter.

## Recommendation
make the necessary functions internal or give them proper access control.
