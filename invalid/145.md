# Unintended Usage of address(this) as Recipient in Uniswap V3 Swap Function
## Summary
 The recipient field is used to specify the  address that will receive the swapped tokens.  the swapped tokens are transferred to the same address that initiated the swap, you should use `msg.sender` instead of` address(this)`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `setSwapAndRoute` function in the `SwapRouter` contract is responsible for calling the swap function. The `setSwapAndRoute` function takes in the asset token and the swap route as parameters, and it sets the new swap route by calling the `setSwapRoute` function.
Once the new swap route is set, the swap function can be called through the `onlyRouter `modifier, which ensures that only the specified router can execute the swap. The swap function executes the actual swapping of tokens based on the provided swap route.
## Impact
The unintended usage of address(this) as the recipient in the Uniswap V3 Swap function can lead to incorrect token transfers and potential loss of funds. Instead of transferring the swapped tokens to the address that initiated the swap, it mistakenly attempts to transfer them to the contract address itself.
it could potentially result in funds being trapped within the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the relevant piece of code to use `msg.sender` instead of address(this) as the recipient in the `IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams` structure.
