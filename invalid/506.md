# Possible Re-entrancy Attack
## Summary

Possible Re-Entrancy possible due to user defined paramters in function

## Vulnerability Detail

The _handleRebalanceOut function appears to be vulnerable to a potential re-entrancy attack due to its use of user-defined data, such as parameters. Specifically, the withdrawUnderlying function could potentially be exploited if it is linked to a malicious contract address, thereby enabling a re-entrancy attack

## Impact
Possible Funds Drain

## Code Snippet

```solidity
idleDebtChange = _handleRebalanceOut(
            LMPDebt.RebalanceOutParams({
                receiver: msg.sender,
                destinationOut: params.destinationOut,
                amountOut: params.amountOut,
                tokenOut: params.tokenOut,
                _baseAsset: baseAsset,
                _shutdown: shutdown
            }),
            destInfoOut
        );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To enhance the security of your smart contract, it is advisable to adhere to the Check Effect Interaction pattern designed for Solidity functions. Alternatively, you may also consider utilizing the ReEntrancy Guard from Openzeppelin, particularly if you intend to make this function public.
