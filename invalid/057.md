# Unintended token distribution due to the hardcoded Extra Rewards Parameter in `createVault` Function in LMPVaultFactory
## Summary
The `createVault` function within the `LMPVaultFactory` contract of the Tokemak Protocol has a hardcoded parameter `allowExtraRewards`, which is always set to `true` when initializing the `MainRewarder` contract. This unintended behavior could lead to unforeseen consequences and potential security risks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `createVault` function is responsible for creating new vaults and associating them with `MainRewarder` contracts for reward distribution. However, the problem lies in the way the `MainRewarder` contract is instantiated and initialized:
```solidity
MainRewarder mainRewarder = new MainRewarder{ salt: salt}(
    systemRegistry,
    newToken,
    address(systemRegistry.toke()),
    defaultRewardRatio,
    defaultRewardBlockDuration,
    true // allowExtraRewards
);
```
In this code snippet, the `allowExtraRewards` parameter is hardcoded to `true`, indicating that all newly created `MainRewarder` instances will allow extra rewards, regardless of the intended behavior. This lack of configurability can lead to potential security vulnerabilities and economic impacts.
## Impact
The impact of this issue is that all newly created vaults will have extra rewards enabled by default, even if the protocol's intention was to allow it on a per-vault basis. This behavior can result in unintended token distribution, economic imbalances, and potential security risks if extra rewards are exploited.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, the `createVault` function should be updated to accept an explicit parameter for `allowExtraRewards`. By doing so, the caller of the function can specify whether extra rewards should be enabled or not for each specific vault.
