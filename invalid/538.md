# receive() in GPToke is broken since it can not call safeTransferFrom from self due to lack of self allowance
## Summary
receive() in GPToke is broken since it can not call safeTransferFrom from self due to lack of self allowance

## Vulnerability Detail
GPToke implements `receive()` which would deposit the donated eth into weth, then call self.addWETHRewards with the donated amount for the accounting. However, `addWETHRewards` would call safeTransferFrom which requires allowance from the spender to the contract. Since GPToke do not have self allowance this call would revert.

```solidity
    receive() external payable {
        // appreciate the ETH! wrap and add as rewards
        weth.deposit{ value: msg.value }();
        GPToke(payable(this)).addWETHRewards(msg.value);
    }
```

```solidity
    function addWETHRewards(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(amount, "amount");

        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        Errors.verifyNotZero(supply, "supply");

        totalRewardsEarned += amount;
        accRewardPerShare += amount * REWARD_FACTOR / supply;

        emit RewardsAdded(amount);

        weth.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```

I try to run such PoC but seems the suites have InitCodeExceedLimit issue so i verified this on remix through some mock setup.

PoC in test/staking/Staking.t.sol
```solidity
    function testDonation() public {
        address bob = address(1);
        deal(bob, 1 ether);
        vm.prank(bob);
        vm.expectRevert("ERC20: insufficient allowance");
        payable(gpToke).call{value: 1 ether}("");
    }
```

## Impact
eth donation does not work.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
consider one of the following:

1. directly implement the addWETHRewards logic in the receive() function.
2. check if the sender is self in addWETHRewards, if so directly do accounting.
3. include self allowance during contract construction.
