# The queueNewRewards function may revert when the block number is less than periodInBlockFinish
## Summary

When the current block number is less than the `periodInBlockFinish` value, [this](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L245-L254) code branch of the queueNewRewards function is executed. If the [setDurationInBlock function](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L212) is invoked to update the `durationInBlock` value to a value that is less than the previous value, the calculation for the [`elapsedBlock`](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L245) may then underflow for a period of time because the following statement may be true: 
```solidity
              block.number < (periodInBlockFinish - durationInBlock)
```
 This would have the effect of not allowing new rewards to be queued for the protocol while this statement is true.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the current block number is less than the `periodInBlockFinish` value, the [`elapsedBlock`](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L245) is calculated through the following equation:
```solidity
            uint256 elapsedBlock = block.number - (periodInBlockFinish - durationInBlock);
```
If the `durationInBlock` value is then updated to be less than the previous value through the [setDurationInBlock function](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L212) by the address with the respective access role, the following statement may be true:
```solidity
              block.number < (periodInBlockFinish - durationInBlock)
```
This would cause the `elapsedBlock` calculation to result in an underflow for a period of time.

## Impact

This would disallow additional rewards from being sent to the protocol while the `elapsedBlock` calculation results in an underflow.

## Recommendation

As a mitigation for this, it is recommended to refactor the [setDurationInBlock function](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L212) so that the [notifyRewardAmount function](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L274) is invoked with the current `queuedRewards` value, resetting the value to zero after the invocation, when the new `durationInBlock` value is less than the previous once the new value is set. This will ensure that the new [`periodInBlockFinish`](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L288) value is calculated with the new `durationInBlock` value which will prevent the potential DOS for the queueNewRewards function. This can be implemented by refactoring the function to the following:
```solidity
    function setDurationInBlock(uint256 _durationInBlock) external hasRole(Roles.DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        // @audit recommended mitigation
        uint256 oldDurationInBlock = durationInBlock;
        durationInBlock = _durationInBlock;
        if(oldDurationInBlock < _durationInBlock){
            notifyRewardAmount(queuedRewards);
            queuedRewards = 0;
        }
        emit RewardDurationUpdated(_durationInBlock);
    }
```
