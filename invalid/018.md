# Paving the Path to Unpredictability by Uninitialized Variables
## Summary
the rewardTokens and amountsClaimed arrays are initialized without specifying their size. This leads to unpredictable behavior and potential crashes when these arrays are used to store data without proper initialization, leading to confusion among users and potential misinformation and loss of funds
## Vulnerability Detail
 Here is the vulnerable part : 
```solidity
function _claimRewards(address rewarder, address sendTo) internal returns (uint256[] memory, address[] memory) {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(rewarder, "rewarder");
        address account = address(this);

        IReward reward = IReward(rewarder);

        // Fetching the earned rewards information
        IReward.EarnedInfo[] memory earnedInfos = reward.earned(account);
        uint256 length = earnedInfos.length;

        address[] memory rewardTokens = new address[](length);
        uint256[] memory amountsClaimed = new uint256[](length);

        // Iterating over each reward info, if earned is not zero, reward is claimed
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            IReward.EarnedInfo memory earnedInfo = earnedInfos[i];
            IERC20 rewardToken = IERC20(earnedInfo.rewardToken);
            rewardTokens[i] = address(rewardToken);

            if (earnedInfo.earned == 0) {
                amountsClaimed[i] = 0;
                continue;
            }

            // Fetching the current balance before claiming the reward
            uint256 balanceBefore = rewardToken.balanceOf(sendTo);

            // Claiming the reward
            // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
            reward.getReward(sendTo, uint8(i));

            // Calculating the claimed amount by comparing the balance after claiming the reward
            amountsClaimed[i] = rewardToken.balanceOf(sendTo) - balanceBefore;
        }

        RewardAdapter.emitRewardsClaimed(rewardTokens, amountsClaimed);

        return (amountsClaimed, rewardTokens);
    }
}
```
Here is a scenario can use by an attacker, it's can  deploys a contract that interacts with the MaverickRewardsAdapter library. By exploiting uninitialized variables, the attacker manipulates the rewardTokens and amountsClaimed arrays. resulting inaccurate claimed rewards data being emitted through events, and leading to confusion among users and potential misinformation.
Exploit: The attacker's contract would utilize uninitialized variables and then trigger the reward claiming process, when the rewards claimed event is emitted, the manipulated data would be displayed, potentially causing confusion or misleading users about the rewards they've actually earned.
## Impact
Users relying on this event data might make incorrect decisions regarding their staking activities or rewards management, potentially leading to financial losses.

## Recommendation
-  Initialize the rewardTokens and amountsClaimed  arrays with the correct size before using them to store data.
