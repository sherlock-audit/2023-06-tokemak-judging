# Potential Underflow in Token Pricing Calculation
## Summary
The smart contract function getPriceInEth retrieves the price of a token in Ether using Chainlink's Oracle service. However, there is a potential vulnerability in the code that could lead to underflow during the calculation of the normalized price. This vulnerability arises when the decimals value is greater than 18, causing the subtraction of decimals from 18 to result in an underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail
If a provided token has the decimals value is greater than 18, as an example YAMv2 has 24 decimals, subtracting decimals from 18 would lead to an underflow, potentially resulting in incorrect token pricing calculations.

## Impact
If this vulnerability is exploited, it could lead to inaccurate token pricing calculations. This could impact various parts of the smart contract that rely on accurate pricing data, potentially leading to financial losses or other unexpected behavior.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/ChainlinkOracle.sol#L121


    function getPriceInEth(address token) external returns (uint256) {
        ChainlinkInfo memory chainlinkOracle = _getChainlinkInfo(token);
        ...
        uint256 decimals = chainlinkOracle.decimals;
        ...
        uint256 normalizedPrice = decimals == 18 ? priceUint : priceUint * 10 ** (18 - decimals);

        return _denominationPricing(chainlinkOracle.denomination, normalizedPrice, token);
    }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to add a check to ensure that the decimals value is not greater than or equal to 18 before performing the subtraction
