# Insufficient Handling of Non-Zero Approvals in `_ensureTokenOrderAndApprovals` Function
## Summary
The `_ensureTokenOrderAndApprovals` function is designed to validate tokens related to a specific pool and approve their spending. However, the function lacks proper handling of tokens that have non-zero approval values, particularly in cases where tokens, such as Tether (USDT), revert the `approve` function when the current approval is not zero. This behavior can lead to unexpected errors and hinder the proper functioning of the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
Below is a detailed explanation of the vulnerability in the `_ensureTokenOrderAndApprovals` function:
```solidity
 // grant spending approval to balancer's Vault
            if (currentAmount != 0) {
                hasNonZeroAmount = true;
                LibAdapter._approve(currentToken, address(vault), currentAmount);//TODO: 
            }
```

## Impact
The code as currently implemented does not handle tokens such as USDT properly. This would prevent USDT, the sixth largest pool, from being used by this project.
