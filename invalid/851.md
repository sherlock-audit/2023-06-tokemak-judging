# CurveV1StableSwap.sol#swap() function should be payable
## Summary
`CurveV1StableSwap.sol#swap()` function is supposed to receive ETH value because it calls the `weth.deposit{ value: amount }()` function but the `CurveV1StableSwap.sol#swap()` function is not `payable` so all transactions to it that includes ETH value will fail

## Vulnerability Detail
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/CurveV1StableSwap.sol#L44 - L55

`CurveV1StableSwap.sol#swap()` function is not `payable` so all transactions with ETH value to the function will fail. 
At the end of the function below, it is expected to deposit ETH to the `weth` contract but the function is not `payable` to be able to allow the ETH. 
```solidity

```
## Impact
Transactions including ETH value to CurveV1StableSwap.sol#swap() function will all fail.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function swap(
        address poolAddress,
        address sellTokenAddress,
        uint256 sellAmount,
        address buyTokenAddress,
        uint256 minBuyAmount,
        bytes memory data
    ) external override onlyRouter returns (uint256 amount) {
        (int128 sellIndex, int128 buyIndex, bool isEth) = abi.decode(data, (int128, int128, bool));
        ICurveV1StableSwap pool = ICurveV1StableSwap(poolAddress);

        IERC20(sellTokenAddress).safeApprove(poolAddress, sellAmount);

        amount = pool.exchange(sellIndex, buyIndex, sellAmount, minBuyAmount);

        // The rest of the system only deals in WETH
        if (isEth && buyTokenAddress == address(weth)) {
            // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-eth
            weth.deposit{ value: amount }();//@audit not payable check router.
        }
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `payable` keyword should be added to the `CurveV1StableSwap.sol#swap()` function and validate the amount of ETH.
