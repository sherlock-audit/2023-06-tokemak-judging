# Decrease in NAV results in users being unable to exit the vault
## Summary

A decrease in NAV might result in users being unable to exit the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail

The LMPVault's `withdraw` and `redeem` functions implement the `noNavDecrease` modifier. Based on the source code's comment at Line 898 below, it was understood that the intention is to ensure that the NAV does not decrease beyond rounding tolerance. 

The problem is that it only considers rounding error but fail to take into consideration the fact that trading fee and slippage during the swapping of non-base assets to base asset (WETH) will inevitably incur some losses, which might decrease the NAV beyond the rounding tolerance, resulting in users unable to exit the vault.

File: LMPVault.sol
147:     modifier noNavDecrease() {
148:         (uint256 oldNav, uint256 startingTotalSupply) = _snapStartNav();
149:         _;

901:         uint256 ts = totalSupply();
902:         if (ts == 0 || startingTotalSupply == 0) {
903:             return;
904:         }
905:         uint256 lowerBound = Math.max(oldNav, NAV_CHANGE_ROUNDING_BUFFER) - NAV_CHANGE_ROUNDING_BUFFER;
906:         uint256 newNav = (totalAssets() * MAX_FEE_BPS) / ts;
907:         if (newNav < lowerBound) {
908:             revert NavChanged(oldNav, newNav);
909:         }

Assume an LMPVault with the following states:

- `totalIdle` = 0
- `totalDebt` = 50 WETH
- `totalAssets` = 50 WETH
- LMPVault consists of two (2) destination vaults (1 Balancer wstETH/sfrxETH/rETH DV and 1 Arbitrary Curve DV). Each has a debt value of 25 ETH.

Assume that Bob attempts to withdraw a certain number of LMPVault shares worth 5 WETH. Since there are insufficient idle assets on the LMPVault, it will need to burn some Balancer DV shares and exit BPT to recall the invested funds.

It is important to note that the price of Balancer DB shares/BPT is computed via the DV's `debtValue` function, which internally calls the `BalancerLPComposableStableEthOracle.getPriceInEth` function to return the fair market price of the BPT.

Based on the Balancer DV's `debtVault` function, it is determined that $x$ number of BPT is worth 5 WETH. In this case, $x$ BPT is proportionally exited, and the Balancer DV received back three different tokens (wstETH/sfrxETH/rETH). Since they are not the base asset (WETH), all three tokens need to be swapped to the base asset (WETH) via the configured DEX (e.g., Uniswap). At least three swaps (might be more if multi-routes are configured) must be executed. 

Let $y_{weth}$ be the number of base assets (WETH) received from the swaps. Swap or trade will always incur trading fees and slippage. As a result, the base asset (WETH) received back from the swaps is definitely less than 5 WETH ($y_{weth} < 5\ {eth}$), which entails a decrease in NAV. If the decrease goes beyond the configured rounding tolerance, users will not be able to exit the vaults.

## Impact

Users might be unable to exit the vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Review if it is crucial to have the `noNavDecrease` modifier. If not, consider removing them. Otherwise, the modifier should take into consideration a possible drop in NAV due to the slippage and trading fee incurred while swapping from non-base assets to base assets and determine if it falls within the acceptable limit.
