# Potential Allowance Exploit in BaseAsyncSwapper's swap Function
## Summary
The BaseAsyncSwapper contract contains a potential vulnerability in the swap function, which allows users to set any tokens as parameters. This can lead to an unintended allowance exploit, where the AGGREGATOR can be granted an allowance to spend more tokens than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
The swap function in the BaseAsyncSwapper contract approves the AGGREGATOR to spend the sellAmount of the sellToken. However, due to the way the function is designed, a user can set both the buyToken and sellToken to the same address. This is particularly concerning because, as indicated in [the comment at line 250 of liquidationRow.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L250), the swapper checks that the amount received is greater or equal to the params.buyAmount. This means a malicious actor can call the swap function with a buyAmount of a very small value (e.g., 1) and a sellAmount of the entire token balance, leading to the AGGREGATOR being approved to spend nearly the entire balance of the token.

## Impact
Given that the function is public and users can set any tokens as parameters, this vulnerability can be exploited by any user to grant excessive allowances to the AGGREGATOR. If the AGGREGATOR is malicious or compromised, it can lead to a loss of funds for the contract.
This vulnerability report is based on the current implementation of the BaseAsyncSwapper contract. It's important to note that the swap function is marked as virtual, meaning it can be overridden in derived contracts. If derived contracts provide a secure implementation that addresses this issue, they may not be vulnerable.

```solidity
    function swap(SwapParams memory swapParams) public virtual nonReentrant returns (uint256 buyTokenAmountReceived) {
        if (swapParams.buyTokenAddress == address(0)) revert TokenAddressZero();
        if (swapParams.sellTokenAddress == address(0)) revert TokenAddressZero();
        if (swapParams.sellAmount == 0) revert InsufficientSellAmount();
        if (swapParams.buyAmount == 0) revert InsufficientBuyAmount();

        IERC20 sellToken = IERC20(swapParams.sellTokenAddress);
        IERC20 buyToken = IERC20(swapParams.buyTokenAddress);

        uint256 sellTokenBalance = sellToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        if (sellTokenBalance < swapParams.sellAmount) {
            revert InsufficientBalance(sellTokenBalance, swapParams.sellAmount);
        }

        LibAdapter._approve(sellToken, AGGREGATOR, swapParams.sellAmount);

        uint256 buyTokenBalanceBefore = buyToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        // we don't need the returned value, we calculate the buyTokenAmountReceived ourselves
        // slither-disable-start low-level-calls,unchecked-lowlevel
        // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
        (bool success,) = AGGREGATOR.call(swapParams.data);
        // slither-disable-end low-level-calls,unchecked-lowlevel

        if (!success) {
            revert SwapFailed();
        }

        uint256 buyTokenBalanceAfter = buyToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        buyTokenAmountReceived = buyTokenBalanceAfter - buyTokenBalanceBefore;

        if (buyTokenAmountReceived < swapParams.buyAmount) {
            revert InsufficientBuyAmountReceived(buyTokenAmountReceived, swapParams.buyAmount);
        }

        emit Swapped(
            swapParams.sellTokenAddress,
            swapParams.buyTokenAddress,
            swapParams.sellAmount,
            swapParams.buyAmount,
            buyTokenAmountReceived
        );

        return buyTokenAmountReceived;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a mechanism to calculate the exact amount of sellAmount required before calling the approve function. This will ensure that only the necessary allowance is granted to the AGGREGATOR, especially since the priority is on the buyAmount.

After the swap, consider resetting the allowance for the AGGREGATOR to zero, ensuring no remaining allowance can be exploited in the future.
```solidity
LibAdapter._approve(sellToken, AGGREGATOR, 0);
```
