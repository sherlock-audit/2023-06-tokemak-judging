# stakers lose points when they extend their stakes
## Summary
When stakers decide to extend their stakes, they end up losing their new points
## Vulnerability Detail
when the extend function is called by a staker, their new duration is passed to the `previewPoints` where the new end and the new points are returned. 

the `previewPoints` function treats the duration as a new stake so the end will be new and the points will be new

if you staked for a year and you extend by 2 years then your new points will be twice as much which should be then added to the one from the one year.

however this doesn't happen, the ones from the 2 years become the new points in total.

`lockup.points = newPoints;` to `lockup.points += newPoints;`
