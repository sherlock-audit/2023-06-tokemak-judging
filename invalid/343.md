# The extend function has no assertion that the points have increased passed the supply max
## Summary

The [extend function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L158) of the GPToke contract allows for a user to extend the staking period for their staked rewards. This is done by invoking the extend function with a respective `lockupId` and new `duration` indicating how much longer the user would like to extend their staking period for the respective staked assets.  However, unlike the [_stake function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L109-L111), their is no assertion that the calculated [`newPoints`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L170C18-L170C27) value will [mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L177) less points than the max supply constraint specified within the assertion of the _stake function as [`type(uint192).max`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L109C37-L109C55).  The extend function can then be used to mint additional points beyond the supply constraint of `type(uint192).max`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [extend function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L158) has no assertion that the newly calculated [points](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L170C18-L170C27) value will cause for the total supply to be less than the max supply constraint specified within the _stake function as [`type(uint192).max`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L109C37-L109C55).

## Impact

Because there is no assertion that the additional points will cause for more points to be minted than the supply constraint, the extend function can then be used to mint additional points passed the supply constraint of `type(uint192).max`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to refactor the [extend function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L158) to include an assertion that the [`newPoints`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L170C18-L170C27) value will not cause more points to be minted then the indicated supply constraint of `type(uint192).max`. This can be done by refactoring the function as follows:
```solidity
    function extend(uint256 lockupId, uint256 duration) external whenNotPaused {
        if (lockupId >= lockups[msg.sender].length) revert LockupDoesNotExist();

        // before doing anything, make sure the rewards checkpoints are updated!
        _collectRewards(msg.sender, false);

        // duration checked inside previewPoints
        Lockup storage lockup = lockups[msg.sender][lockupId];
        uint256 oldAmount = lockup.amount;
        uint256 oldEnd = lockup.end;
        uint256 oldPoints = lockup.points;

        (uint256 newPoints, uint256 newEnd) = previewPoints(oldAmount, duration);
        
        // @audit recommended mitigation: assert that the total
        // supply will be within the supply constraint after minting
        uint256 points = newPoints - oldPoints;
         if (points + totalSupply() > type(uint192).max) {
            revert StakingPointsExceeded();
        }
        if (newEnd <= oldEnd) revert ExtendDurationTooShort();
        lockup.end = uint128(newEnd);
        lockup.points = newPoints;
        lockups[msg.sender][lockupId] = lockup;
        // issue extra points for extension

        // @audit recommended mitigation: use the declared 
        // points variable as the _mint amount parameter
        _mint(msg.sender, points);
        emit Extend(msg.sender, lockupId, oldAmount, oldEnd, newEnd, oldPoints, newPoints);
    }
```
