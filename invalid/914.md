# LMPVault.sol -> DestinationVault.sol is integrated incorrectedly because depositUnderlying is not called so the Vault does not hold LP token to remmove liquidity and withdrawBase
## Summary

LMPVault.sol -> DestinationVault.sol is integrated incorrectedly because depositUnderlying is not called

## Vulnerability Detail

When calling function from LMPVault and mint shares, this is called

```solidity
    function _transferAndMint(uint256 assets, uint256 shares, address receiver) internal virtual {
        // From OZ documentation:
        // ----------------------
        // If _asset is ERC777, `transferFrom` can trigger a reentrancy BEFORE the transfer happens through the
        // `tokensToSend` hook. On the other hand, the `tokenReceived` hook, that is triggered after the transfer,
        // calls the vault, which is assumed not malicious.
        //
        // Conclusion: we need to do the transfer before we mint so that any reentrancy would happen before the
        // assets are transferred and before the shares are minted, which is a valid state.
        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-no-eth
        _baseAsset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

        totalIdle += assets;

        _mint(receiver, shares);

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
    }
```

base asset is supplied, but when withdraw we need to call

```solidity
uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));
```

on destVault,

for example, if the destVault is maverick dest vault, withdrawBaseAsset is expected to burn LP token in exchange for base asset

```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc DestinationVault
    function _burnUnderlyer(uint256 underlyerAmount)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        returns (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts)
    {
        //slither-disable-start similar-names
        (uint256 sellAmountA, uint256 sellAmountB) =
            maverickBoostedPosition.burnFromToAddressAsReserves(address(this), address(this), underlyerAmount);
```

same applies for CurveConexDestinationVault.sol as well, we are removing liquidity so we need to burn LP for base asset

```solidity
   // We always want our tokens back in WETH so useEth false
        (tokens, amounts) = CurveV2FactoryCryptoAdapter.removeLiquidity(
            minAmounts, underlyerAmount, curvePool, curveLpToken, IWETH9(_systemRegistry.weth())
        );
```

but when the LMPVault charge base asset, addLiquidity is never called to add liquidity to exchange base asset to LP token

neither does the depositUnderlying is called, the destVault.withdrawBaseAsset will not work because the vault does not hold LP token

## Impact

LMPVault.sol -> DestinationVault.sol is integrated incorrectedly because depositUnderlying is not called, can block user withdraw

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

add liquidity and deposit base asset to liquidity pool to get LP token so the vault hold LP token
