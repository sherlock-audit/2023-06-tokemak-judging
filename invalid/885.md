# No helper function to remove ExtraRewarder contract instances in MainRewarder
## Summary
The `src/rewards/MainRewarder.sol` contract allows an address with the role - `DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` to add extra reward contracts permanently, with no way to remove them.

## Vulnerability Detail
The **MainRewarder.sol** contract contains the following function which allows an address with the correct role to add extra rewarder contracts:

```solidity
    function addExtraReward(address reward) external hasRole(Roles.DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        if (!allowExtraRewards) {
            revert ExtraRewardsNotAllowed();
        }
        Errors.verifyNotZero(reward, "reward");

        extraRewards.push(reward);

        emit ExtraRewardAdded(reward);
    }
```

No mechanism exists for removing added contracts, which could potentially result in compromised **ExtraRewarder** contracts retaining the ability to receive funds.

## Impact
Extra rewards can be stolen by compromised/malicious **ExtraRewarder** contracts exploiting this persisted access.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Solidity has no way of removing array elements in place besides the `pop()` method, but this is not feasible in this case as the added **ExtraRewarder** contract can only be removed if it's the last entry in the array. The only way would be to clear the entire array:

```solidity
    function removeExtraRewards() external hasRole(Roles.DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        delete extraRewards;

        emit ExtraRewardsRemoved();
    }
```
