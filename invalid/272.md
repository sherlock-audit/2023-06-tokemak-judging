# Double Reward Distribution in _collectRewards Function of GPToke Contract.
## Summary
Double Reward Distribution in **'_collectRewards'** Function of GPToke Contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The **'_collectRewards'** function in the GPToke contract contains a flaw. When the **'distribute'** parameter is set to **'true'**, the rewards for a user are both transferred to the user and added to their **'unclaimedRewards'**. This leads to the rewards being double-counted and transferred, enabling users to claim more rewards than they should. This vulnerability is particularly concerning because there's an external function (**'collectRewards'**) without access control that calls **'_collectRewards'** with the **'distribute'** argument set to **'true'** by default.

## Impact
Users who are aware of this vulnerability can systematically drain the protocol's rewards. Specifically, every time the **'accRewardPerShare'** value increases, these users can exploit the system in two steps:

1. Invoke the **'collectRewards'** function to obtain the extra balance.
2. Retrieve the incorrectly calculated pending rewards.

With each update of **'accRewardPerShare'**, this cycle can be repeated, leading to a consistent drain of the pool's resources. This not only threatens the protocol's financial stability but also compromises the trust and rightful rewards of honest participants.

  ```solidity
/// @dev See {IGPToke-collectRewards}.
    function _collectRewards(address user, bool distribute) internal returns (uint256) {
        // calculate user's new rewards per share (current minus claimed)
        uint256 netRewardsPerShare = accRewardPerShare - rewardDebtPerShare[user];
        // calculate amount of actual rewards
        uint256 netRewards = (balanceOf(user) * netRewardsPerShare) / REWARD_FACTOR;
        // get reference to user's pending (sandboxed) rewards
        uint256 pendingRewards = unclaimedRewards[user];

        // update checkpoint to current
        rewardDebtPerShare[user] = accRewardPerShare;

        // if nothing to claim, bail
        if (netRewards == 0 && pendingRewards == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (distribute) {
            //
            // if asked for actual distribution, transfer all earnings
            //

            // reset sandboxed rewards
            unclaimedRewards[user] = 0;

            // get total amount by adding new rewards and previously sandboxed
            uint256 totalClaiming = netRewards + pendingRewards;

            // update running totals
            totalRewardsClaimed += totalClaiming;
            rewardsClaimed[user] += totalClaiming;

            emit RewardsClaimed(user, totalClaiming);

            // send rewards to user
            weth.safeTransfer(user, totalClaiming);

            // return total amount claimed
            return totalClaiming;
        }

        if (netRewards > 0) {
            // Save (sandbox) to their account for later transfer
            unclaimedRewards[user] += netRewards;

            emit RewardsCollected(user, netRewards);
        }

        // nothing collected
        return 0;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the addition of **'netRewards'** to **'unclaimedRewards'** should only occur when **'distribute'** is set to false. This can be achieved by restructuring the logic inside the **'_collectRewards'** function:
```solidity
if (distribute) {
    ...
    // send rewards to user
    weth.safeTransfer(user, totalClaiming);
} else {
    if (netRewards > 0) {
        // Save (sandbox) to their account for later transfer
        unclaimedRewards[user] += netRewards;
    }
}

```
