# Function `getPriceInEth` in `BalancerLPMetaStableEthOracle.sol` will revert 100% of the time
## Summary
Function `getPriceInEth` is used to get the price of balancer lp in ETH, but it will revert 100% of the time it gets called, which will make the pricing impossible.
## Vulnerability Detail
`getPriceInEth` tries to call `getLastInvariant` on the balancer pool to get the Invariant from it

and it stores the value returned in a uint256. The problem relies in the fact that the function `getLastInvariant` on the balancer pools return always 2 variables and not one, as you can see from some examples from the pools the protocol intends to interact with

https://etherscan.io/address/0x1E19CF2D73a72Ef1332C882F20534B6519Be0276#readContract#F9
Because of that, the call will always revert and so will `getPriceInEth`, which will make pricing the balancer's LP for the meta stable pools impossible.
## Impact
Impact is a medium one because pricing will be impossible.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create a tuple with two variables instead of only one, even if you don't intend to use both, because otherwise the call will always revert.
