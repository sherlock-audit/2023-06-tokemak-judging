# erroneous accounting in LMPVault.sol#_withdraw function
## Summary
erroneous accounting in LMPVault.sol#`_withdraw` function

## Vulnerability Detail

LMPVault.sol line 482
```solidity
                uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
                uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));

                // Destination Vault rewards will be transferred to us as part of burning out shares
                // Back into what that amount is and make sure it gets into idle
                info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
                info.totalAssetsPulled += assetPulled;
                info.debtDecrease += totalDebtBurn;
```
Above is a snippet from the `_withdraw` function. In this function we can observe erroneous accounting. Specifically in the place below
```solidity
info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
```
let me do a poc on why this accounting is erroneous

1. first we assign assetPreBall `uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this))`
2. this will just give the balance of the user, let us say it is 100 of token x
3. then call withdrawBaseAsset and assign the return value to assetPulled: `uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this))`
4. let us say this value is 10 of token x. so value of 10 will be added, now asset after is 110
5. now we get to the problem... `info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;`
6. let us plug in the values and see what we get
7. `_baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this))` = 110
8. `assetPreBal` = 100
9. `assetPulled` = 10
10. 110- 100 - 10 = 0 this will assign a 0 `idleIncrease` when the increase infact was 10
11. this will then cause problems with the calculation of `totalIdle` because it uses the erroneous `idleIncrease` variable when it is calculated
12. `totalIdle = info.currentIdle + info.idleIncrease - info.assetsFromIdle;`
13. now this affects other areas such as the one below
```solidity
uint256 idle = totalIdle + idleIncrease;
        uint256 debt = totalDebt - prevNTotalDebt + afterNTotalDebt;

        totalIdle = idle;
        totalDebt = debt;
```
the above snippet is from the function `_updateDebtReporting`
14. `_collectFees(idle, debt, totalSupply())` collectFees function now has erroneous data.
```solidity
uint256 currentNavPerShare = ((idle + debt) * MAX_FEE_BPS) / totalSupply;
        uint256 effectiveNavPerShareHighMark = navPerShareHighMark;

        if (currentNavPerShare > effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) {
            // Even if we aren't going to take the fee (haven't set a sink)
            // We still want to calculate so we can emit for off-chain analysis
            profit = (currentNavPerShare - effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) * totalSupply;
            fees = profit.mulDiv(performanceFeeBps, (MAX_FEE_BPS ** 2), Math.Rounding.Up);
            if (fees > 0 && sink != address(0)) {
                // Calculated separate from other mints as normal share mint is round down
                shares = _convertToShares(fees, Math.Rounding.Up);
                _mint(sink, shares);
                emit Deposit(address(this), sink, fees, shares);
            }
            // Set our new high water mark, the last nav/share height we took fees
            navPerShareHighMark = currentNavPerShare;
            navPerShareHighMarkTimestamp = block.timestamp;
            emit NewNavHighWatermark(currentNavPerShare, block.timestamp);
        }
        emit FeeCollected(fees, sink, shares, profit, idle, debt);
```
In the end the incorrect amount of fees will be collected, this is a loss of funds. the erroneous accounting is a contagion as it is also used elsewhere in the protocol.

## Impact
erroneous accounting in `_withdraw` will lead to accounting issues related to rebalance and collectFees this can cause the protocol to be missing funds/ these funds are lost.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
the current implementation is 
```solidity
info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
```

a possible fix is this below
```solidity
info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal
```
