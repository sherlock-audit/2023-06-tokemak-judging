# Funds can get stuck in the Balancer Vault
## Summary
If tokens in balancer vault gets change, funds can get stuck in the balancer vault, because of `poolTokens` array in the `BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol` cannot get change.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the Balancer, when user want join to the pool or exit from the pool, one parameter is [`assets`](https://docs.balancer.fi/reference/joins-and-exits/pool-joins.html#token-ordering) , Sorted list of all tokens in pool. `assets` must have the same length and order as the array returned by `getPoolTokens`. This prevents issues when interacting with Pools that register and deregister tokens frequently.

- ```When providing your assets, you must ensure that the tokens are sorted numerically by token address. It's also important to note that the values in maxAmountsIn correspond to the same index value in assets, so these arrays must be made in parallel after sorting.```

In the `BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol` contract, `poolTokens` variable is for keep track tokens that are exist in the balancer pool and be used when `DV` need to join to the pool or exit from the pool. `poolTokens` variable is set only once in `initialize` method.

The `poolTokens` array is used when `BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol` needs to withdraw funds from balancer vault, in this process contract should pass the array of token address and array of `minAmountsOut`.

The problem is that, tokens in the balancer vault can gets add and there is functions from balancer in the `PoolTokens.sol` contract in order to do it. but in the `BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol` contract, `poolTokens` array initialized just once and there is not any function to edit it in future.
- https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/227683919a7031615c0bc7f144666cdf3883d212/pkg/vault/contracts/PoolTokens.sol#L30

If tokens in the balancer vault can get added, the `_withdraw` function in the `BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol` contract will get reverted because of the below condition check. This makes the withdrawal from `BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol` not be done.
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol#L294C1-L298C10

Currently, the `Add/Remove tokens` feature is not active, but considering that there are functions to implement it, this feature can be activated in the future.
- https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/pools/more/deployments.html#current-versions

In the balancer, there is a function called `_validateTokensAndGetBalances` to check that `poolTokens` array provided from the user is same as the token array returned by `getPoolTokens`. if they are not same, withdraw transaction will get reverted.
- https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/227683919a7031615c0bc7f144666cdf3883d212/pkg/vault/contracts/PoolBalances.sol#L293C1-L294C89

## Impact
So if in balancer, tokens in the vault get edit, `assets` array from `BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol` will not be same as `assets` array in the balancer and this can cause to withdraw transaction get reverted and funds get stuck in balancer pool.

## Recommendation
Consider to add function in order to edit `poolTokens` array.
