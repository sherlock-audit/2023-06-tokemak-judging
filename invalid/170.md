# Inconsistent Staking Process in `depositAndStake` Function
## Summary
The `depositAndStake` function in the provided Solidity contract does not align with the documented staking process for LP positions at Convex/Aura. The function directly stakes Curve LP tokens without wrapping them into the associated Convex/Aura ERC20 token, as described in the documentation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositAndStake` function is designed to deposit and stake Curve LP tokens on the Convex platform. According to the provided documentation, when staking at Convex/Aura, an associated ERC20 token that wraps the Curve LP token should be used for staking. However, the function doesn't include the step of wrapping the LP tokens into this ERC20 token before staking.
## Impact
The direct staking of LP tokens might not align with the Convex/Aura platform's intended functionality and could potentially result in loss of rewards or other unintended consequences.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `depositAndStake` function should be modified to include the necessary steps for wrapping the Curve LP tokens into the associated Convex/Aura ERC20 token before staking.
