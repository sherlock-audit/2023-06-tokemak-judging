# Unsafely downcasted
## Summary
unsafely downcasted 
## Vulnerability Detail
The parameter 'i' is being forcefully converted to the uint8 type.
## Impact

If the value of 'length' is greater than the maximum range of uint8 (255), truncation will occur during the conversion, resulting in an inaccurate value for 'i' and the inability to call reward.getReward() properly.

```solidity

// Iterating over each reward info, if earned is not zero, reward is claimed
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            IReward.EarnedInfo memory earnedInfo = earnedInfos[i];
            IERC20 rewardToken = IERC20(earnedInfo.rewardToken);
            rewardTokens[i] = address(rewardToken);



            if (earnedInfo.earned == 0) {
                amountsClaimed[i] = 0;
                continue;
            }



            // Fetching the current balance before claiming the reward
            uint256 balanceBefore = rewardToken.balanceOf(sendTo);



            // Claiming the reward
            // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
            reward.getReward(sendTo, uint8(i));

Manual Review

## Recommendation
safely downcast the number to make sure the number is not shortened unexpectedly.
