# A malicious user may steal wETH balance in the LMPVaultRouter.sol
## Summary
If the `LMPVaultRouter` contract has balance for `erc20Token`, a malicious user can steal it.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is `sweepToken` function in the `PeripheryPayments.sol` contract. this function is using to transfer avalaible balance for `erc20Token` to an address. so we can assume that there is a case that `erc20Token` or `wETH` token can become available in the `LMPVaultRouter` contract. `LMPVaultRouter` is `LMPVaultRouterBase.sol` and this is `PeripheryPayments.sol`. **_please pay attention that `sweepToken` and `refundETH` has no access control and this is know as bug._**

In the `LMPVaultRouter.sol` contract and `withdrawToDeposit` function, the `_deposit` function is using exact value of input `amount` from the user.

In the `withdraw` process, we know that `LMPVaultRouter.sol` contract cannot receive the exact amount of requested `amount` from `DV` contracts. for example if user input for `amount` is 10 wETH, then `LMPVaultRouter.sol` can receive 9.9 wETH.

But in the `_deposit` function, the contract is trying to use the exact 10 wETH value. Now if `LMPVaultRouter` contract has balance for wETH, 0.1 wETH from balance of contract will get deposit for the user.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I Recommend to use `beforeBalance` and `afterBalance` pattern in order to deposit actual amount for user.
