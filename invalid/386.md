# Lost rewards when `StakeTracker` transfers to a contract that can't handle reward tokens
## Summary
`StakeTracker` tokens automatically receive rewards and stake on transfers, leading to lost tokens when interacting with external smart contracts that can't deal with them (for example, Uniswap).

## Vulnerability Detail
The reward system of `MainRewarder` and `AbstractRewarder` is coupled with the `StakeTracker`, which is either the [`LMPVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L834-L865) or [`DestinationVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L335-L353) (only the `LMPVault` is relevant as the shares of the destination vaults always belong to the `LMPVault`). Whenever there is a token transfer, the `from` address withdraws from the rewarder and gets the rewards, while the `to` address stakes. Thus, if the `StakeTracker` tokens are transferred to a smart contract that can't handle the extra reward tokens, it stakes on behalf of this smart contract, whose rewards are then lost when withdrawing the `StakeTracker` tokens out of it.

## Impact
Lost rewards, it's impossible to say how much but should be a significant amount, as there are many DeFi protocols that can't handle the rewards.

## Code Snippet
In the `DestinationVault` (`LMPVault` is similar):
```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
	if (from == to) {
		return;
	}

	if (from != address(0)) {
		_rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
	}
}

function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
	if (from == to) {
		return;
	}

	if (to != address(0)) {
		_rewarder.stake(to, amount);
	}
}
```
The `true` flag means that the rewards are claimed on [`withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L82), causing stuck rewards when trasferring out of a smart contract that can't handle them.

## Recommendation
Stake manually instead of on every token transfer. Another option is to transfer the rewards to the `to` address on token transfer instead of claiming to the `from` address, but this would be more confusing.
