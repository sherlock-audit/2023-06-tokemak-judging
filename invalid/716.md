# When DestinationVault is at loss, LMPVault._withdraw may revert in some cases due to underflow
## Summary

[[_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L231)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L231) is used to figure out how many shares we can burn from the destination as well as what our totalDebt deduction should be (totalDebt being a cached value). If its at a loss, they can only burn an amount proportional to their ownership of LMPVault. `totalDebtBurn` is the return value of this function, which is calculated based on the cached values. Since DestinationVault is at a loss, `totalDebtBurn` represents past debts, which may be higher than `totalAssetsToPull`. This will cause the subtraction underflow in [[L475](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L475)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L475) and revert. Users cannot withdraw funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

This problem can occur when `totalIdle` has funds, but not enough to cover the funds the user wants to withdraw. `_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn` returns two values: `sharesToBurn` and `totalDebtBurn`. `totalDebtBurn` represents the past debt, and `sharesToBurn` represents the share to be withdrawn in DestinationVault. When DestinationVault is at a loss, the `assetPulled` by `destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this))`Â may be less than `totalDebtBurn`. If `totalDebtBurn` is greater than `info.totalAssetsToPull`, then subtraction underflow may occur at L475. In other words, this condition is met: `assetPulled < info.totalAssetsToPull < totalDebtBurn`. Because when i=1, the `info.debtDecrease` and `info.totalAssetsPulled` of L475 are equivalent to `totalDebtBurn` and `assetPulled` obtained when i=0 (L488-489).

## Impact

When DestinationVault is at a loss, users may not be able to withdraw funds due to underflow.
