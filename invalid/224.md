# Users still receive bonus multipliers after lock has expired.
## Summary
Users are still able to earn rewards applied with lock multipliers even after their stakes have ended. They are able to keep the bonus for as long as they wish while having the ability to withdraw their tokens at any time they wish.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users are currently able to gain bonus multipliers based on stake lengths. 
However once the stake ends there points remain the same and no shares are burned. 
This allows them to still receive the bonus rewards without the penalty of being unable to withdraw. 
If they wish to continue to receive the bonus multiplier they should have have to extend their stake and relock their tokens.

## Impact
Users with expired locks will still be receiving multiplied rewards even though their tokens are no longer locked resulting in fewer rewards for others with locked tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a kick method that allows anyone to remove any multipliers on an expired users stake. 

```Solidity
function kick(uint256 lockupId, address _user) external {
        if (lockupId >= lockups[_user].length) revert LockupDoesNotExist();

        // get staking information
        Lockup memory lockup = lockups[_user][lockupId];
        uint256 amount = lockup.amount;
        uint256 end = lockup.end;
        uint256 points = lockup.points;

        // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
        if (block.timestamp < end) revert NotUnlockableYet();
        if (end == 0) revert AlreadyUnlocked();

        // checkpoint rewards
        _collectRewards(_user, false);

        // burn any shares gained from multiplier
        _burn(points - amount);

        // Update users points to base amount (multipler of 1)
        lockups[_user].points = amount;
}
```
