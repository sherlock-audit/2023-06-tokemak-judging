# Over/Under-collection of liquidation fee
## Summary

Over/Under-collection of liquidation fee lead to a loss of reward for the users or a loss for the protocol team as it cannot recoup the expenses.

## Vulnerability Detail

It is understood from the protocol team that the idea of charging a fee in `LiquidationRow` contract is to be able to recoup the costs of running the liquidation service.

Assume that the price of CVX is $3, and there are 100,000 CVX to be liquidated. This means that it will receive 181 ETH after the swap.

Assume that the liquidation fee is 1%. In this case, 1.8 ETH will be charged as the fee for executing the liquidation. 1.8 ETH is worth around $3000. It is unlikely that the gas fee required to execute the liquidation process (claiming reward + swap + queuing rewards) will cost \$3000. Thus, the liquidation fee will be "over-collected", especially when there is a large number of reward tokens to be swapped in one go.

Note that breaking down the liquidation of reward tokens into smaller chunks or having it executed more frequently so that it will not grow to a huge sum is not a solution to this issue, as the liquidator will end up incurring more gas fees. The most efficient manner is to accumulate the reward tokens to a reasonably large amount and perform the swap in one go.

The root cause of this issue is that the liquidation fee charge is proportional to the reward tokens swapped while the gas needed to execute the liquidation process is more or less constant. For example, the gas needed to swap 10 CVX to WETH and 100,000 CVX to WETH are relatively constant.

On the other hand, the liquidator will not be able to recoup the expenses if the number of reward tokens collected is extremely few.

```solidity
File: LiquidationRow.sol
240:     function _performLiquidation(
..SNIP..
253:         // if the fee feature is turned on, send the fee to the fee receiver
254:         if (feeReceiver != address(0) && feeBps > 0) {
255:             uint256 fee = calculateFee(amountReceived);
256:             emit FeesTransfered(feeReceiver, amountReceived, fee);
257: 
258:             // adjust the amount received after deducting the fee
259:             amountReceived -= fee;
260:             // transfer fee to the fee receiver
261:             IERC20(params.buyTokenAddress).safeTransfer(feeReceiver, fee);
262:         }
```

## Impact

If the liquidation fee is "over-collected", it leads to a loss of reward for the users

If the liquidation fee is "under-collected", it results in a loss for the protocol team as it cannot recoup the expenses.

## Recommendation

Consider performing benchmarks to determine the gas (+ some slight buffer) needed to execute the liquidation process. The estimated gas fee can be obtained by multiplying the gas needed by the gas price obtained on-chain from Chainlink's [Fast Gas feed](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/gas/fast-gas-gwei). Finally, add some margin to factor in the cost of running the infrastructure and compensation for the protocol team for maintaining and configuring the infrastructure. This will prevent the over-collecting of liquidation fees.
