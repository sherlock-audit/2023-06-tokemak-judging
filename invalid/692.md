# Incorrect Points Calculation in previewPoints Function
## Summary
The `previewPoints` function in the smart contract contains an error in the calculation of points. The function uses `end - startEpoch` instead of `end - start` for calculating the `endYearpoc`, which impacts the multiplier. This allows a newly staked user to earn rewards as if they staked from the very beginning.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the incorrect calculation of `endYearpoc`. The code uses the difference between `end `and `startEpoch `to calculate the `endYearpoc`. This results in a miscalculation of the multiplier, which in turn affects the points awarded to the user.

## Impact
A user who stakes their assets can potentially earn more rewards than they should. This can lead to an unfair distribution of rewards and can be exploited by malicious actors to gain an undue advantage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the calculation of `endYearpoc `to use the difference between end and start instead of `end` and `startEpoch`. This will ensure that the points are calculated correctly based on the actual staking duration.
