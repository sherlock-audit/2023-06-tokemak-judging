# Not having an expiry for swaps could lead to user loss/ excuting swap in unfair stuations for users
## Summary

Swaps need a deadline protection

## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at the atached code snippets below:

- [UniV3Swap::swap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/UniV3Swap.sol#L46-L65)

```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc ISyncSwapper
    function swap(
        address routerAddress,
        address sellTokenAddress,
        uint256 sellAmount,
        address,
        uint256 minBuyAmount,
        bytes memory data
    ) external override onlyRouter returns (uint256) {

        IERC20(sellTokenAddress).safeApprove(routerAddress, sellAmount);

        IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
            path: data,
            recipient: address(this),
            //@audit
            deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: minBuyAmount
        });

        return IUniswapV3SwapRouter(routerAddress).exactInput(params);
    }

```

From above snippets we can see that requested swaps would be forever valid and not have an expiry date, whereas the slippage check is being correctly implemented to ensure that even if the swap gets executed in a later time it should still be in the favor of the user _in tokens to be received_, this is not always the case, cause a user would decide their `minBuyAmount` based on the current USD value of a token, and in the case where swap doesn't get executed for a long time (_hours, days, weeks..._) and the price of the token to be bought drops massively (_not an uncommon occurence in the crypto world_), user's swap would still be unfairly executed since there is no expiry and all attacker needs to do is cache trade in the mempool and run later. In order to avoid this scenario, a deadline param is needed to be provided by user.

## Impact

Users requested swap execuction doesn't have an expiry time which would lead to possible unfair execution of users swaps since Tx can be executed with outdated prices, to be more exact... _massive loss in USD value_.

Manual Audit

## Recommendation

Due to scenarios like this it's advisable to not only include slippage in swaps but even deadlines.
### Additional Note:
A similar idea of bug resides in [BalancerV2Swap::swap()]() 

```solidity
    function swap(
        address,
        address sellTokenAddress,
        uint256 sellAmount,
        address buyTokenAddress,
        uint256 minBuyAmount,
        bytes memory data
    ) external override onlyRouter returns (uint256) {
        bytes32 poolId = abi.decode(data, (bytes32));

        IVault.SingleSwap memory singleSwap =
            IVault.SingleSwap(poolId, IVault.SwapKind.GIVEN_IN, sellTokenAddress, buyTokenAddress, sellAmount, "");

        IVault.FundManagement memory funds = IVault.FundManagement(address(this), false, payable(address(this)), false);


        IERC20(sellTokenAddress).safeApprove(address(vault), sellAmount);
//@audit
        return vault.swap(singleSwap, funds, minBuyAmount, block.timestamp);
    }
}
```
