# Current implementation of getting the price of a token in Eth would lead to it's overvaluation.

## Summary

The ChainlinkOracle.getPriceInEth() eventually calls the `_getPriceDenominationUSD()` function, which is used to calculate the price of an asset in terms of ETH when given its normalized price in USD. This is done by both querying the prices, i.e that of the token against USD and price of ETH against USD, but this execution does not take into account the fact that the price returned from USD pricefeeds are in 8 decimals and instead hardcodes a multiplication of `10 **18` in an attempt to get the normalised price in terms of eth, which leads to the overvaluation of the token by 10 decimals

## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at [`_getPriceDenominationUSD`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/base/BaseOracleDenominations.sol#L60-L63)

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Necessary due to of USD / Eth price feed.  Price of both assets in USD make it possible
     *      to get `normalizedPrice` in terms of Eth.  Many assets are priced in USD as opposed to Eth
     *      on Chainlink price feeds.
     *
     * @param normalizedPrice  Normalized price of asset in USD
     */
    function _getPriceDenominationUSD(uint256 normalizedPrice) private returns (uint256) {
        uint256 ethInUsd = systemRegistry.rootPriceOracle().getPriceInEth(ETH_IN_USD);
//@audit
        return (normalizedPrice * (10 ** 18) / ethInUsd);
    }
}

```

As seen, the problem lies in the multiplication of 18 decimals. However, the Chainlink feed for USD prices returns values with 8 decimals. Thus, the conversion logic inflates the overall returned price by an extra factor of `10 ** 10`.

## Impact

Overinflation of price by 10 decimals
