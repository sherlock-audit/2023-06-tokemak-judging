# Out-of-gas errors might happen during the withdrawal
## Summary

Out-of-gas errors might happen during the withdrawal, resulting in users being unable to withdraw their assets from the vault

## Vulnerability Detail

If all the DVs are in a loss, the code is forced to loop through all the DVs during withdrawal. An out-of-gas error might happen if the number of DVs supported by the LMPVault is significant and the interaction with various external protocols (e.g., Curve, Balancer) consumes much gas. 

In addition, the number of DVs that can be added to the LMPVault is unbounded in the current codebase.

```solidity
File: LMPVault.sol
448:     function _withdraw(
..SNIP..
468:             // Using pre-set withdrawalQueue for withdrawal order to help minimize user gas
469:             uint256 withdrawalQueueLength = withdrawalQueue.length;
470:             for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawalQueueLength; ++i) {
471:                 IDestinationVault destVault = IDestinationVault(withdrawalQueue[i]);
472:                 (uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) = _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
473:                     destVault,
474:                     shares,
475:                     info.totalAssetsToPull - Math.max(info.debtDecrease, info.totalAssetsPulled),
476:                     totalVaultShares
477:                 );
478:                 if (sharesToBurn == 0) {
479:                     continue;
480:                 }
481: 
482:                 uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
483:                 uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));
```

## Impact

Users might be unable to withdraw their assets from the vault under the abovementioned conditions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider restricting the number of DVs that can be added to the withdrawal queue and perform the necessary benchmark to ensure that an out-of-gas error does not occur after adding new DVs to the queue.
