# Rewards and extra rewards can be claimed from the `LMPVault` even while the contract is paused
## Summary

Due to missing protection mechanisms, rewards and extra rewards can be claimed from `LMPVault` even while the contract is paused, by bypassing the existing protection mechanism in `LMPVault`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LMPVault.claimRewards()` can only be called if the `LMPVault` is not paused, due to the `whenNotPaused` function modifier. Thus users can't claim their rewards and extra rewards while `LMPVault` is paused. However a user can bypass this and still claim all their rewards even while the `LMPVault` is paused by directly calling `MainRewarder.getReward()` which is lacking any modifier or protection mechanism to disallow claiming the rewards while the `LMPVault` is paused.

This issue also applies to the extra rewards, which can be also claimed anytime even when the `LMPVault` is paused, since `ExtraRewarder.getReward()` is also lacking a protection mechanism.

## Impact

Rewards and extra rewards can be claimed despite that the `LMPVault` is paused by bypassing the protection mechanism as described above.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing some protection mechanism for the existing `MainRewarder.getReward()` methods so that users can't claim their rewards while the `LMPVault` is paused. This could be done by adding the modifier `onlyStakeTracker` to the `MainRewarder.getReward()` methods.

Consider implementing some protection mechanism for the `ExtraRewarder.getReward()` methods so that users can't claim their extra rewards while the vault is paused. This might be done by adding the modifier `mainRewardOnly` to the `ExtraRewarder.getReward()` methods.
