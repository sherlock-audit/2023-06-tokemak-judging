# extraRewards can be spammed to make reward claims expensive
## Summary
The extraRewards array is public. A malicious contract could spam it to make it very gas expensive to iterate, preventing users from claiming rewards
## Vulnerability Detail 
The extraRewards array is public  [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L30) This array is iterated over in _processRewards()  [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L108-L118)
A malicious contract could exploit this by:
- Calling addExtraReward() repeatedly to bloat the extraRewards array size.
- This would make the for loop in _processRewards() very gas expensive.
- Users would be unable to claim rewards due to high gas costs.

## Impact
It becomes very gas intensive, costing a significant amount of ETH per reward claim
