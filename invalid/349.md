# No Deadline & No Slippage Exposes Users To Potential Loss of All Their Reward Tokens
## Summary
No slippage and no deadline exposes users to potential loss of their input tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
The **UniV3Swap.swap()** is used to swap claimed assets back to base assets

```solidity
        IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
            path: data,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: minBuyAmount
        });
```
The "amountOutMinimum" is the minimum amount of output tokens from the swap. According to the [protocol's docs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/README.md), this amount will always be 0. Also, the third parameter accepts block.timestamp as its deadline meaning the transaction can be pending in mempool and executed at a much later time (as whenever this transaction gets added in a block is its block.timestamp) making it possible for the user to receive the least optimal amount for their reward token  or loss funds from MEV bots sandwich attacks.
## Impact
All reward tokens can be sandwiched and stolen

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend the protocol add deadline check and add slippage control.
