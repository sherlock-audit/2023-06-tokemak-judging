# Adding and removing liquidity of any form will revert when Balancer pool is paused

## Summary

Inability to execute `addLiquidity(), removeLiquidty(), removeLiquidityComposableImbalance(), removeLiquidityImbalance( )` _i.e withdrawals of any kind_.

NB: Case extensively affects all instances of call to the aforementioned functions in contracts in scope

## Vulnerability Detail

Balancer's `joinPool` and `exitPool` are present in some instances in scope, key to note that during the course of the contest and in audit's external integration [readME section](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/tree/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a#q-in-case-of-external-protocol-integrations-are-the-risks-of-external-contracts-pausing-or-executing-an-emergency-withdrawal-acceptable-if-not-watsons-will-submit-issues-related-to-these-situations-that-can-harm-your-protocols-functionality), sponsors have discussed the below:

> Q: In case of external protocol integrations, are the risks of external contracts pausing or executing an emergency withdrawal acceptable? If not, Watsons will submit issues related to these situations that can harm your protocol's functionality.

> A: Pausing or emergency withdrawals are not acceptable for Tokemak.

Meaning that pausing or emergency situations are not acceptable on tokemak.

Now take a look at [addLiquidity()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol#L88-L136)

```solidity
 function addLiquidity(
        IVault vault,
        address pool,
        address[] calldata tokens,
        uint256[] calldata exactTokenAmounts,
        uint256 minLpMintAmount
    ) public {
 ...ommited for brevity
//@audit
        vault.joinPool(
            poolId,
            address(this), // sender
            address(this), // recipient of BPT token
            _getJoinPoolRequest(pool, tokens, exactTokenAmounts, minLpMintAmount)
        );

 ...ommited for brevity
        _emitDeploy(exactTokenAmounts, tokens, bptBalances, pool, poolId);
    }
```

Take a look at [removeLiquidity()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol#L151-L187) which essentiallly calls [`_withdraw()]`(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol#L271-L352) inorder to escape stack too deep errors

```solidity
  function _withdraw(IVault vault, WithdrawParams memory params) private returns (uint256[] memory amountsOut) {
       ...ommited for brevity
        // As we're exiting the pool we need to make an ExitPoolRequest instead
        IVault.ExitPoolRequest memory request = IVault.ExitPoolRequest({
            assets: BalancerUtilities._convertERC20sToAddresses(poolTokens),
            minAmountsOut: amountsOut,
            userData: params.userData,
            toInternalBalance: false
        });
        vault.exitPool(
            poolId,
            address(this), // sender,
            payable(address(this)), // recipient,
            request
        );

       ...ommited for brevity

        emit WithdrawLiquidity(
            amountsOut,
            tokens,
            [bptBalanceBefore - bptBalanceAfter, bptBalanceAfter, poolInterface.totalSupply()],
            pool,
            poolId
        );
        //slither-disable-end reentrancy-events
    }

```

Key to note that Balancer pool is designed such that, it will allow `joinPool()` or `exitPool()` only when it is not paused, so when Balancer pool is paused, `addLiquidity()` and `_withdraw()` will mot work

## Impact

The vault are not able to add liquidity or make withdrawals

## Tool used

Manual Audit

## Recommendation

Balancer implemented the pause mechanism to tackle the certain emergent situations. It is suggesed to follow the same mechanism for tokemak as well. If Balancer pool `joinpool()` and `exitpool()` are paused, pause the functions that use this on tokemak.
