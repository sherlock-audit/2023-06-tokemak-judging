# Unsafe downcasting in the lockup.end value in GPToke.sol
## Summary

Whenever the user calls extend, the lockup.end value will be downcasted.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the extend() function of GPToke.sol, the lockup.end variable is a uint256 variable. When creating a new lockup.end value, the newEnd variable is downcasted to uint128. 

```solidity
->        uint256 oldEnd = lockup.end;
        uint256 oldPoints = lockup.points;


        (uint256 newPoints, uint256 newEnd) = previewPoints(oldAmount, duration);


        if (newEnd <= oldEnd) revert ExtendDurationTooShort();
->        lockup.end = uint128(newEnd);
```

If the user were to extend the staking duration again, then the newEnd will become the oldEnd, which means that the uint128 variable will upcast to uint256.  

## Impact

Unsafe Downcasting issue may lead to wrong values being stored.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend leaving the variable type as is.

```solidity
-        lockup.end = uint128(newEnd);
+       lockup.end = uint256(newEnd);
```
