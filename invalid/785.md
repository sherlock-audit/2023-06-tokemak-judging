# openzeppelin's safeApprove() function is depracated / Incorrect safeApprove() usage
## Summary
The openzeppelin's `safeApprove()` function will revert if the previous allowance is not reset to zero.
 The require statement and the comments explains it all from the the safeApprove function from openzeppelin's codebase.
```solidity
/**
     * @dev Deprecated. This function has issues similar to the ones found in
     * {IERC20-approve}, and its usage is discouraged.
     *
     * Whenever possible, use {safeIncreaseAllowance} and
     * {safeDecreaseAllowance} instead.
     */
function safeApprove(
        IERC20 token,
        address spender,
        uint256 value
    ) internal {
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
        require(
            (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
    }

```

## Vulnerability Detail
The safeApprove function of the ERC20 of openzeppelin contract is depracated because it reverts if the previous allowance is not zero.
The safeApprove function prevents changing an allowance between non-zero values to mitigate a possible front-running attack. It reverts if that is the case. Instead, the safeIncreaseAllowance and safeDecreaseAllowance functions should be used. 
Comment from the OZ library for this function: “
// safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance, 
// or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use 
// 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and ‘safeDecreaseAllowance'"

If the existing allowance is non-zero (say, for e.g., previously the entire balance was not deposited due to vault balance limit resulting in the allowance being reduced but not made 0), then safeApprove() will revert causing denial-of-service.

```

## Impact
Transactions with safeApprove from non zero allowance will revert causing Denial of transaction.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function mint(
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 shares,
        uint256 maxAmountIn
    ) public payable virtual override returns (uint256 amountIn) {
        // handle possible eth
        _processEthIn(vault);

        IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
        uint256 assets = vault.previewMint(shares);
        pullToken(vaultAsset, assets, address(this));
        vaultAsset.safeApprove(address(vault), assets);

        amountIn = vault.mint(shares, to);
        if (amountIn > maxAmountIn) {
            revert MaxAmountError();
        }
    }

```
