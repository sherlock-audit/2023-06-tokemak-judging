# Extra rewards may be lost if the `MainRewarder.clearExtraRewards` method gets called before the user claims their extra rewards
## Summary

If a user has unclaimed extra rewards those extra rewards may be lost if governance calls `MainRewarder.clearExtraRewards()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In general, users claim their extra rewards by calling `MainRewarder.getReward()`. By doing so `MainRewarder._processRewards()` gets called where the `extraRewards` are being processed one after another by iteration - see line 113-114 `MainRewarder` contract.

If a user never claimed their extra rewards or if new extra rewards accumulated, the user usually would be able to call `MainRewarder.getReward()` so that they would receive their extra rewards. 

But if governance calls `MainRewarder.clearExtraRewards()`, the users would potentially lose their unclaimed extra rewards, because when the user would afterwards call `MainRewarder.getReward()`, the list of `extraRewards` would be either empty so that on line 113 in the `MainRewarder` contract there would be no `extraRewards` available any more to claim since they were removed by governance. Or maybe the `extraRewards` were meanwhile replaced by other `extraRewards`, i.e. governance called the `clearExtraRewards` method and then added other extra rewards by calling the method `addExtraReward` in `MainRewarder` contract.

## Impact

Users may lose their unclaimed extra rewards. Also, there is no protection in place against this issue. Therefore this might lower the incentive of users to deposit their assets into the protocol's vaults, since the reward system has this existing issue as a downside.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider introducing a timelock mechanism, so that users can react before they lose their unclaimed extra rewards. Only after the timelock period ends, which could be a week for example, the extra rewards are then being effectively deleted. This would protect users from losing their extra rewards.
