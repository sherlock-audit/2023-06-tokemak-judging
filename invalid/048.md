# Lack of Configurable Minimum Amount during Liquidity Removal in BalancerAuraDestinationVault
## Summary
The `BalancerAuraDestinationVault` contract lacks configurability for the minimum amount during liquidity removal, leading to potential risks and missed opportunities. The absence of a configurable minimum amount might expose users to slippage-related issues and missed arbitrage opportunities. Additionally, the current hardcoded value of 0 may lead to unintended consequences when users attempt to remove liquidity.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises in the `_burnUnderlyer` function of the `BalancerAuraDestinationVault` contract. During liquidity removal, the contract calls the `BalancerBeethovenAdapter.removeLiquidityComposableImbalance` function from an external library. The `removeLiquidityComposableImbalance function` takes a `minAmounts` argument, which currently uses a hardcoded value of 0.
```solidity
function _burnUnderlyer(uint256 underlyerAmount)
    internal
    virtual
    override
    returns (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts)
{
    uint256[] memory minAmounts = new uint256[](poolTokens.length);
    tokens = _convertToAddresses(poolTokens);
    amounts = isComposable
        ? BalancerBeethovenAdapter.removeLiquidityComposableImbalance(
            balancerVault,
            balancerPool,
            underlyerAmount,
            BalancerUtilities._convertERC20sToAddresses(poolTokens),
            minAmounts,
            0 // Hardcoded value of 0
        )
        : BalancerBeethovenAdapter.removeLiquidityImbalance(
            balancerVault,
            balancerPool,
            underlyerAmount,
            BalancerUtilities._convertERC20sToAddresses(poolTokens),
            minAmounts
        );

    // Existing code...
}
```

## Impact
 By setting the minimum amount to 0, users may remove liquidity without any protection against slippage, leading to potential financial losses. Furthermore, the hardcoded value of 0 might prevent the contract from taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities, which could result in suboptimal liquidity management.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is essential to implement proper validation and constraints when accepting the configurable minimum amount to ensure it falls within acceptable bounds. By providing the necessary flexibility, the contract can offer a more secure and efficient liquidity management solution for its users.
