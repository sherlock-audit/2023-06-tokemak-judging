# Per wallet limit should not be applied to a special address such as liquidity pool / staking pool / lending pool
## Summary
Per wallet limit could be applied to a vital adress

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `_beforeTokenTransfer` ther is this logic
```solidity
 function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused {
        // Nothing to do really do here
        if (from == to) {
            return;
        }

        // If this isn't a mint of new tokens, then they are being transferred
        // from someone who is "staked" in the rewarder. Make sure they stop earning
        // When they transfer those funds
        if (from != address(0)) {
            rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
        }

        // Make sure the destination wallet total share balance doesn't go above the
        // current perWalletLimit
        if (balanceOf(to) + amount > perWalletLimit) {
            revert OverWalletLimit(to);
        }
    }
```

what this function does is check the callers balance of the to address and adds that balance to the amount to be transfered to it. 
if the new sum is over the perWalletLimit, then the function will revert

This is a problem because let us assume that a user is add liquidity or trading on a Uniswap V3 style  liquidity pool or third party integrated staking vault that accure reward for the tokenmak vault token or supply asset to a lending pool that build on top of the token staking vault

Since pools and vaults usually have large amounts of tokens, in most cases depending on how large the parWalletLimit is, the user will not be able to transfer his tokens to the pool or vault.

also if the protocol increase the perWalletLimit to accommodate liquidity pool then it is unlikely individual user balance exceed liquidity pool balance 
then perWalletLimit does not serve the purpose of limiting user balance

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
one solution is to whitelist key addresses that are vital to the protocol, these addresses should not be subject to the perWalletLimit
