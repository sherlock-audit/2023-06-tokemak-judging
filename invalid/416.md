# reentrancy protection using checkReentrancy is not gas-efficient and can be front-run.
## Summary
The reentrancy protection using checkReentrancy is not gas-efficient. It makes an external call to withdraw fees which could be front-ran
## Vulnerability Detail 
The key parts of the code are:
1. In registerPool(), checkReentrancy is set to 1 if reentrancy checks should be performed: [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/CurveV1StableEthOracle.sol#L87) 
2. In getPriceInEth(), if checkReentrancy is 1, it calls withdraw_admin_fees() on the Curve pool: [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/CurveV1StableEthOracle.sol#L132-L137) 
3. withdraw_admin_fees() is an external call that modifies state.

The vulnerability is that the withdraw_admin_fees() call can be front-run. An attacker could call getPriceInEth(), see the withdraw_admin_fees() call, then quickly call their own malicious reentrant call to getPriceInEth() again before the withdraw completes. 

In essence, this is not gas-efficient because it makes an external call every time. It can also be front-run - an attacker could see this external call happening and insert their own reentrant call before the fees are withdrawn. For example:

- Attacker sees withdraw_admin_fees call about to happen
- Attacker quickly makes a reentrant call back into getPriceInEth before fees are withdrawn
- getPriceInEth executes again before the first call finishes
- Attacker exploits reentrant logic

This is possible because external calls in Solidity do not happen atomically.

 
## Impact
An attacker could call getPriceInEth(), see the withdraw_admin_fees() call, then quickly call their own malicious reentrant call to getPriceInEth() again before the withdraw completes. This could allow the attacker to extract funds or cause other issues.
