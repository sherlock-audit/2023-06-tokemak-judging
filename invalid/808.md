# All ETH sent to SwapRouter.sol will be lost
## Summary
The `SwapRouter.sol` contract implements the `receive()` function to receive ether but does not have a withdraw function nor an implementation to wrap ether as claimed in the comment.
```solidity
receive() external payable {//@audit eth will be lost
        // we accept ETH so we can unwrap WETH
    }

```
