# the stake() function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks
## Summary
stake() calls out to the IExtraRewarder(extraRewards[i]).stake() external contract without reentrancy protection
## Vulnerability Detail
This could be exploited by:

- Attacker calls stake()
- The external call to IExtraRewarder is made
- The IExtraRewarder implementation executes malicious logic and recursively calls back into stake() or withdraw()
- This repeats draining funds or manipulating state
## Impact
This could lead to inflating stake amounts or stealing funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adding the nonReentrant modifier prevents reentrancy and fixes the vulnerability
