# Wrong previewPoints calculation
## Summary
GPToke.sol
previewPoints():L192
Calculation of `endYearpoc` is wrong


## Vulnerability Detail
There is a sentence `endYearpoc = ((end - startEpoch) * 1e18) / 365 days;` that should get amount of years that staker staked their value. But here `startEpoch` used instead of `start`, so it will calculate years starting form date of deploy that contract always. And even if staker going to stake their value for 1 day, `endYearpoc` will get several years anyway, so staker wiil get extra points on their stake

## Impact
Protocol will loose as much value as many years will be passed since deploy

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L192

    function previewPoints(uint256 amount, uint256 duration) public view returns (uint256 points, uint256 end) {
        if (duration < minStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooShort();
        if (duration > maxStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooLong();

        // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
        uint256 start = block.timestamp > startEpoch ? block.timestamp : startEpoch;
        end = start + duration;

        // calculate points based on duration from staking end date
        uint256 endYearpoc = ((end - startEpoch) * 1e18) / 365 days;
        uint256 multiplier = PRBMathUD60x18.pow(YEAR_BASE_BOOST, endYearpoc);

        points = (amount * multiplier) / 1e18;
    }

## Recommendation
Use `duration` instead of `(end - startEpoch)`
