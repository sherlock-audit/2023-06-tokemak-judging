# changing duration in between reward emission period will lead into incorrect queuedRation calculation
## Summary
The `setDurationInBlock()` function in the `AbstractRewarder` contract lacks restrictions on when the `durationInBlock` can be changed. Consequently, modifying the `durationInBlock` during an emission period will result in wrong calculations of the start of the period in the `queueNewRewards()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. In `queueNewRewards()` function of `AbstractRewarder` contract `elapsedBlock` is being calculated to calculate the rewards emitted till that block in current emission.
2. But while calculating `elapsedBlock`, `durationInBlock` is being used which if increased or decreased in between period will lead to wrong calculation of `elapsedBlock`.
3. This results in an inaccurate calculation of the `queuedRatio`, which in turn disrupts the rewards queuing mechanism.

## Impact
1. The reward queuing mechanism will not work as intended.
2. Rewards will not be queued when they should be queued. 
3. Or rewards will queued when they shoudn't

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function setDurationInBlock(uint256 _durationInBlock) external hasRole(Roles.DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    // @audit missing finishAt < block.number check
    durationInBlock = _durationInBlock;
    emit RewardDurationUpdated(_durationInBlock);
}
```
   
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
   function setDurationInBlock(uint256 _durationInBlock) external hasRole(Roles.DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
+     require(block.number > periodInBlockFinish,"reward duration not finished");
      durationInBlock = _durationInBlock;
      emit RewardDurationUpdated(_durationInBlock);
   }
```
