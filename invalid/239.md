# Possibility of Missing Vault Rewards after Liquidation
## Summary
Possibility of Missing Vault Rewards after Liquidation due to absence of an important validation at the ConvexRewardsAdapter.sol  contract which could in extension affect proper execution of claimsVaultRewards(...) function in the LiquidationRow.sol contract
## Vulnerability Detail
A analytical look at L117 of claimsVaultRewards(...) function of the LiquidationRow.sol contract shows that tokens array coming from vault.collectRewards() function has a vulnerability point, this can be observed by tracing down the origin of this function : 
first  at L178-L180 of  _collectRewards() function of the CurveConvexDestinationVault.sol contract.
then second at L69-L74 of  _claimRewards(....) function of the ConvexRewardsAdapter.sol contract.
a careful look is needed of the_claimRewards(....) function especially the rewardPool variable  at L58 then it usage at 71.  Doing adequate research into the tokemak entire codebase shows that no point in time was the length or values of the rewardPool.extraRewards(i) confirmed if it syncs with length of rewardTokens[i] before it assignment and usage.
## Impact
Possibility of Missing Vault Rewards after Liquidation due to absence of an important validation at the ConvexRewardsAdapter.sol  contract which could in extension affect proper execution of claimsVaultRewards(...) function in the LiquidationRow.sol contract which could result to reward calculation error and lose of fund, the chances of this error happening is dependent on user error which makes it low but the impact of this vulnerability is high in cases when it happens which makes this submission a medium

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A validation confirmation to ensure Maximum return address length and values of rewardPool.extraRewards is equivalent to the maximum length of the component of  rewardTokens[i] to be assigned or simply the value of extraRewardsLength. Another approach is to ensure the validation at each loop cycle
```solidity
58.  IBaseRewardPool rewardPool = IBaseRewardPool(gauge);
...
 +++ require( rewardPool.extraRewards(extraRewardsLength-1) != address(0) ,"Error Message")
   +++ require( rewardPool.extraRewards.length == rewardTokens.length ,"Error Message")
64.        if (extraRewardsLength > 0) {
65.            for (uint256 i = 0; i < extraRewardsLength; ++i) {
   +++ require( rewardPool.extraRewards(i) != address(0) ,"Error Message")
67.                address extraReward = rewardPool.extraRewards(i);
68.                rewardTokens[i] = address(IBaseRewardPool(extraReward).rewardToken());
69.            }
70.        }
