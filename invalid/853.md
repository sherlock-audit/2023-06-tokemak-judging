# `ICurveOwner(pool.owner()).withdraw_admin_fees(address(pool));` may not hold true for checking read only re-entrancy in all pools
## Summary
`ICurveOwner(pool.owner()).withdraw_admin_fees(address(pool));` may not hold true for checking read only re-entrancy in all pools
## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, Tokemak is checking for read-only re-entrancy in curve by calling the `withdraw_admin_fees` function from curve.

Reentrancy locks are different depending on different curve versions. There are some curve pool versions that do not have the `withdraw_admin_fees` where checking the read-only re-entrancy would not work.

## Impact
Unable to check for read-only re-entrancy in older pools

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Call `remove_liquidity` instead of `withdraw_admin_fees`
