# Low-level calls does not check the contract existence & it returns true even if the contracts which are not not existing.
## Summary
call/delegatecall/staticcall does not check the contract existence. Since call/delegatecall/staticcall returns true even if the contracts which are not not existing. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Low-level calls call/delegatecall/staticcall return true even if the account called is non-existent (per EVM design). Solidity documentation warns: "The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.”

There are few cases used the call/staticcall in the below contracts without checking the contract existence. 


## Impact
Here it checked the address for nonzero but still low-level calls return true nonzero(address) nonexisting contracts. Checking only retune value success is not enough to evaluate transactions done correctly. So It should be checked for contract existence as well in order to confirm the transaction occurred correctly.

## Recommendation

Check for the  account.code.length > 0 . 
For [BaseAsyncSwapper.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/BaseAsyncSwapper.sol#L14C1-L17C6) contract, 


        14              constructor(address aggregator) {
        15                  if (aggregator == address(0)) revert TokenAddressZero();
        ++                  if (aggregator.code.length = 0) revert NonContract();
        16                 AGGREGATOR = aggregator;
        17             }    


  

Same mitigation can be applied for BalancerV2Swap.sol as well.
