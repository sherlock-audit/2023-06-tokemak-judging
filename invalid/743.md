# A validator can deny swap transaction until it becomes advantageous
## Summary
Using `block.timestamp` as `deadline` for swap function can allow a validator deny swap transaction until it becomes advantageous.

```solidity
IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
            path: data,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp, //@audit literal timestamp should be passed here.
            amountIn: sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: minBuyAmount
        });
```
## Vulnerability Detail
File: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/UniV3Swap.sol#L59

Using `block.timestamp` as `deadline` for swap function can allow a validator deny swap transaction until it becomes advantageous.
Because Front-running is a key aspect of AMM design, deadline is a useful tool to ensure that your tx cannot be “saved for later”. Allow users to pass a literal value of timestamp for which the transaction should revert.
```solidity
IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
            path: data,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp, //@audit deadline
            amountIn: sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: minBuyAmount
        });
```
## Impact
Due to the use of `block.timestamp` as the `deadline`, it may be more profitable for a validator to deny the transaction from being added until the transaction incurs the maximum amount of slippage, making user lose fund.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function swap(
        address routerAddress,
        address sellTokenAddress,
        uint256 sellAmount,
        address,
        uint256 minBuyAmount,
        bytes memory data
    ) external override onlyRouter returns (uint256) {
        IERC20(sellTokenAddress).safeApprove(routerAddress, sellAmount);//@audit safeapprove

        IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
            path: data,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp, //@audit deadline
            amountIn: sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: minBuyAmount
        });

        return IUniswapV3SwapRouter(routerAddress).exactInput(params);
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow deadline to be passed as input parameter to the swap function because block.timestamp will always be valid anytime the transaction is executed.
