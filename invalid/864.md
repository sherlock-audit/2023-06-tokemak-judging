# No limitations on stake duration extending can parmenently DOS staking .
## Summary
No limitations on stake duration extending can parmenently DOS staking .
## Vulnerability Detail
The `extend ` function looks like this : 
```solidity 
  function extend(uint256 lockupId, uint256 duration) external whenNotPaused {
        if (lockupId >= lockups[msg.sender].length) revert LockupDoesNotExist();

        // before doing anything, make sure the rewards checkpoints are updated!
        _collectRewards(msg.sender, false);

        // duration checked inside previewPoints
        Lockup storage lockup = lockups[msg.sender][lockupId];
        uint256 oldAmount = lockup.amount;
        uint256 oldEnd = lockup.end;
        uint256 oldPoints = lockup.points;

        (uint256 newPoints, uint256 newEnd) = previewPoints(oldAmount, duration);

        if (newEnd <= oldEnd) revert ExtendDurationTooShort();
        lockup.end = uint128(newEnd);
        lockup.points = newPoints;
        lockups[msg.sender][lockupId] = lockup;
        // issue extra points for extension
        _mint(msg.sender, newPoints - oldPoints);

        emit Extend(msg.sender, lockupId, oldAmount, oldEnd, newEnd, oldPoints, newPoints);
    }
```
 In `GPToke.sol` the `extend `function is used to extend the duration of an amount staked . The staker mints newpoints everytime he extends the duration .

 The issue is `extend ` can be called infinite times with the same lockup  . A malicious staker can exploit this by extending the stake duration infinite times and mint points more than `type(uint192).max` . 

At this time , staking is DOS'ed ! New staking cannot be done as points exceeds the limit of 
type(uint192).max` .  Staking reverts here: 
```solidity 
  if (points + totalSupply() > type(uint192).max) {
            revert StakingPointsExceeded();
        }
```
Also , important to mention that points are used to calculate the rewards of an staker . By minting huge amount of points will make  the exploiter get  all the rewards . 

## Impact

Staking gets DOS'ed and eventually protocol will brick as staking is one of the core functionalities of Tokemak .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
Prevent an user from staking and extending it to infinity.
check if newEnd of extending is exceeding 4 years from current timestamp .
