# previewPoints is calculated wrongly since endYearpoc uses startEpoch instead of start
## Summary
previewPoints is calculated wrongly since endYearpoc uses startEpoch instead of start

## Vulnerability Detail
During execution of `stake`, the staker would specify the duration and this duration is passed into `previewPoints` together with the amount to calculate the points (non-transferrable ERC20 for voting), as well as the end time of this locked position.

```solidity
function _stake(uint256 amount, uint256 duration, address to) internal whenNotPaused {
        //
        // validation checks
        //
        if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
        if (amount < MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT) revert StakingAmountInsufficient();
        if (amount > MAX_STAKE_AMOUNT) revert StakingAmountExceeded();

        // duration checked inside previewPoints
        (uint256 points, uint256 end) = previewPoints(amount, duration);
...
```

On PreviewPoints, points are calculated based on:
1. `amount * multiplier`
2. multiplier comes from `pow(YEAR_BASE_BOOST,  endYearpoc)`, where YEAR_BASE_BOOST is a constant
3. endYearpoc comes from `(end - startEpoch) * 1e18) / 365 days`.

```solidity
    function previewPoints(uint256 amount, uint256 duration) public view returns (uint256 points, uint256 end) {
        if (duration < minStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooShort();
        if (duration > maxStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooLong();

        // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
        uint256 start = block.timestamp > startEpoch ? block.timestamp : startEpoch;
        end = start + duration;

        // calculate points based on duration from staking end date
        uint256 endYearpoc = ((end - startEpoch) * 1e18) / 365 days;
        uint256 multiplier = PRBMathUD60x18.pow(YEAR_BASE_BOOST, endYearpoc);

        points = (amount * multiplier) / 1e18;
    }
```

While end is simply `startTime + duration`, `startEpoch` is an immutable variable assigned during construction, and it never gets updated. It implies that `endYearpoc` would be ever increasing, since `end - startEpoch` would be increasing, as time passes after the contract gets deployed, new staker can would have `end = block.timestamp + duration`, as soon as `block.timestamp > startEpoch`.

## Impact
New TOKE holders who lock their position at a later time, would now get more points than the previously locked person with the same amount.

## Recommendation
use start instead of startEpoch

```solidity
--- uint256 endYearpoc = ((end - startEpoch) * 1e18) / 365 days;
+++ uint256 endYearpoc = ((end - start) * 1e18) / 365 days;
```
