# First depositor on LMPVault.sol can break minting of shares
## Summary
The common "first depositor" vulnerability is found in `LMPVault#deposit()`. The first account to deposit into the LMPVault can steal value from subsequent depositors by:

- Minting 1 wei shares
- Directly transferring assets into the contract to inflate the totalAssets value
- Subsequent depositors deposit assets but are minted 0 shares due to precision loss (+ `Math.rounding.down` specification)
- First depositor steals the assets

## Vulnerability Detail

The depositor's shares are calculated via:
```solidity
//1
    function deposit( 
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver
    ) public virtual override nonReentrant noNavChange ensureNoNavOps returns (uint256 shares) {
       ....
        shares = previewDeposit(assets);
       ... //E other logic to mint shares
    }
//2 
    function previewDeposit(uint256 assets) public view virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, Math.Rounding.Down);
    }
//3 
    //E assets to shares with rounding direction
    function _convertToShares(uint256 assets, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();

        //E shares = (assets == 0 || totalSupply() == 0) ? assets : assets * totalSupply() / totalAssets() +- rounding
        shares = (assets == 0 || supply == 0) ? assets : assets.mulDiv(supply, totalAssets(), rounding);
    }
```

Upon first deposit, the `totalAssets()` value will be 0. The attacker will transact with an `amount = 1 wei` to mint 1 wei of shares. Then the attacker will transfer some value of asset directly to the contract. For this example, the attacker transfers 10,000 USDC.

Next, a subsequent depositor attempts to mint shares with 5,000 USDC.

`shares = 5000 USDC * 1 wei / 10,000 USDC = 0` due to precision loss.

The attacker can now withdraw the second depositor's assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Mint a certain number of shares and transfer them to `address(0)` within the `initialize()` function.
