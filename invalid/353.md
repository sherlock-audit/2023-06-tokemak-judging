# `safeApprove` in `BalancerV2Swap.sol` and `UniV3Swap.sol` could revert 100% which could make withdrawing funds from and protocol impossible
## Summary
The `SwapRouter.sol` is used when a user intends to withdraw funds from the protocol, `swapForQuote` gets called in `DestinationVault.sol` every time a user calls withdraw or redeem in the `LMPVault.sol` or `LMPVaultRouter.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L264-L276
but this call could revert if `BalancerV2Swap.sol` or `UniV3Swap.sol` which would block the withdraw process.
## Vulnerability Detail
Every time the users want to withdraw funds from the protocol the vaults, in the case where it doesn't have enough `idle` funds, calls `withdrawBaseAsset` 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L483
from destinations vaults which calls `swapForQuote` on the `SwapRouter.sol`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L273
Then the router uses different routes and delegatecalls to swap assets to the baseAsset, WETH in our case 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/SwapRouter.sol#L90-L103
Two of the routers used are `BalancerV2Swap.sol` and `UniV3Swap.sol`, in both of them `safeApprove` gets called with the specific amount before calling the swap functions
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/BalancerV2Swap.sol#L62-L64
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/UniV3Swap.sol#L54-L64
The problem relies in the fact that the way UniswapV3 and Balancer vault swaps are functioning, it could happen that not all of the funds approved would be transferred, which could mean that the allowances would remain greater than 0 after the swap. Take the example of UniswapV3 , `exactInput` used in the contract calls `exactInputInternal` 
https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/SwapRouter.sol#L145C31-L152
which calls swap function on different pools 
https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/SwapRouter.sol#L101-L109
and updates the `amountIn` values passed in `ExactInputParams` with the new value, which could be less than the one approved 
https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/SwapRouter.sol#L145C31-L145C49
Because of that `safeApprove` would revert all the time because if the allowances are not 0, it needs to be set to 0 first, to protect against race condition
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/0a25c1940ca220686588c4af3ec526f725fe2582/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L54-L56
This could happen to every ERC20 intended to work and be swapped in the protocol which would make withdrawing funds with those 2 routes impossible.
## Impact
Impact is a high one because the users funds could be blocked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Checks if the allowances are greater than 0 after the swap and use `safeApprove` to 0, if that is the case.
