# GPToke.sol#L267 : `_collectRewards` double counts the rewards for a user when `distribute`
## Summary

[_collectRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L267) is double counting the reward amount when distributing.

## Vulnerability Detail

`GPToke` contract has the [_collectRewards ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L267)which called whenever any state update is called for stake, unstake and extend.
This will update the total unclaimed reward without distributing the reward to the user.

But when the this function is called through the [collectRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L262C14-L262C28), the accumulated rewards and unclaimed rewards are transferred to the user. At the end of the function, it updates the total unclaimed rewards. 

Lets see this issue in codes. Follow the comments.

```solidity
    function _collectRewards(address user, bool distribute) internal returns (uint256) {
        // calculate user's new rewards per share (current minus claimed)
        uint256 netRewardsPerShare = accRewardPerShare - rewardDebtPerShare[user];
        // calculate amount of actual rewards
        uint256 netRewards = (balanceOf(user) * netRewardsPerShare) / REWARD_FACTOR; ------>> for this netRewards.
        // get reference to user's pending (sandboxed) rewards
        uint256 pendingRewards = unclaimedRewards[user];


        // update checkpoint to current
        rewardDebtPerShare[user] = accRewardPerShare;


        // if nothing to claim, bail
        if (netRewards == 0 && pendingRewards == 0) {
            return 0;
        }


        if (distribute) {
            //
            // if asked for actual distribution, transfer all earnings
            //


            // reset sandboxed rewards
            unclaimedRewards[user] = 0;


            // get total amount by adding new rewards and previously sandboxed
            uint256 totalClaiming = netRewards + pendingRewards; --------------->> netRewards is added for totalClaiming.


            // update running totals
            totalRewardsClaimed += totalClaiming;
            rewardsClaimed[user] += totalClaiming;


            emit RewardsClaimed(user, totalClaiming);


            // send rewards to user
            weth.safeTransfer(user, totalClaiming); ------------------>> totalClaiming is sent to user.


            // return total amount claimed
            return totalClaiming;
        }


        if (netRewards > 0) { ---------------------------------------->> this will be still  > 0
            // Save (sandbox) to their account for later transfer
            unclaimedRewards[user] += netRewards; ------------------------->>> again the netRewards is updated as unClaimedRewards.


            emit RewardsCollected(user, netRewards);
        }


        // nothing collected
        return 0;
    }
```

## Impact

Double counting of rewards. Loss of rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

set netRewards = 0, when distributing the rewards. (Inside the if block)
