# `LMPVault.sol` is not fully compliant with EIP4626 as it is stated
## Summary
The ReadMe of the protocol specifies that the `LMPVault.sol` is ERC4626 compatible, which is not the case because of how `maxDeposit` is calculated.
## Vulnerability Detail
It is specified in the EIP4626 that `maxDeposit` : 
- **MUST return the maximum amount of assets deposit would allow to be deposited for receiver and not cause a revert**
- **MUST NOT revert.**

which would not be the case all the time since this function could revert and also revert the functionality of `deposit` function.
`maxDeposit` is calculated by `convertToAssets` the `_maxMint` value of an address

As we can see `_maxMint` can return `type(uint256).max` in the case where there is no limits per spec 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L936-L938
so if that is the case  `type(uint256).max`  will be passed in the in the `_convertToAssets` which does a `mulDiv` with the value passed https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L595-L598 
This `mulDiv` would revert all the time, if the `totalAssets()` would be greater than `totalSupply()`, which should be the case most of the time for the protocol to no be insolvent, because of an overflow. Because of that `maxDeposit` and `deposit` would also revert making the `LMPVault.sol` not fully compliant with EIP4626.
## Impact
Impact is a medium one since other protocols could be using the `LMPVault.sol` assuming it is EIP4626 fully compliant, but it is not.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the way the `maxDeposit` function is calculated in a way to make it fully EIP4626 compliant.
