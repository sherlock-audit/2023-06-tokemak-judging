# No slippage control when swapping from the destination vaults
## Summary
No slippage control when swapping from the destination vaults

## Vulnerability Detail
When withdrawing from destination vaults, there is no slippage control when swapping the tokens. When calling `withdrawBaseAsset()` it will call the swapRouter contract with 0 as minAmountOut, this means that you are accepting maximum slippage.

```solidity
 if (amounts[i] > 0) {
                    IERC20(token).safeApprove(address(swapRouter), amounts[i]);
                    amount += swapRouter.swapForQuote(token, amounts[i], _baseAsset, 0);
                }
```
Not just that, when performing the actual swap, it is passing 0 as minAmountOut again. As you can see in the following snippet:


```solidity
 (bool success, bytes memory data) = address(routes[hop].swapper).delegatecall(
                abi.encodeWithSelector(
                    ISyncSwapper.swap.selector,
                    routes[hop].pool,
                    currentToken,
                    currentAmount,
                    routes[hop].token,
                    0,
                    routes[hop].data
                )
            );
```
## Impact
Swapping function can be sandwiched as there is no slippage control

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a`minAmountOut` parameter to account for slippage
