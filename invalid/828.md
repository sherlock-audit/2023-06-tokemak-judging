# Chainlink Oracle may return incorrect price when chainlinks minPrice() is hit
## Summary

Chainlink aggregators have a circuit breaker that stops asset prices from going too far off a set range. This can sometimes make the oracle consistently give the minimum price instead of the actual price, like during the LUNA crash.

## Vulnerability Detail

Current implementation of [`getPriceInEth()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/ChainlinkOracle.sol#L103) in [`ChainlinkOracle.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/ChainlinkOracle.sol) contract may return the incorrect price of the token when the price goes below minimum price set by the chainlink.


ChainlinkFeedRegistry#latestRoundData extracts the linked aggregator and requests round data from it. If an asset's price falls below the minPrice, the protocol continues to value the token at the minPrice rather than its real value.

For example, if TokenA's price falls from $1 to $0.10, the function might still report $1, causing inflated calculations.

## Impact
As a result, there will be incorrect valuation of the tokens received from external protocols, when that particular token crashes.

## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation

The existing Tokemark contract includes a [`chainlinkInfo`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/ChainlinkOracle.sol#L25-L30) structure that is linked to the respective token within the chainlinkOracleInfo mapping. Just add an additional field to the chainlinkInfo structure to hold the `minPrice` value as well. 

Furthermore, modify the `getPriceInEth()` function to include a check that reverts the transaction if the price falls below the specified minPrice value.
