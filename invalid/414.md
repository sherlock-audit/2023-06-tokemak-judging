# ExtraRewards can accidentally loss
## Summary
ExtraRewards can accidentally loss
## Vulnerability Detail
There is a potential risk of unintentional loss of ExtraRewards. While the function addExtraReward() includes a check for the allowExtraRewards status before adding extra rewards, the clearExtraRewards function lacks any state checks. Additionally, it directly deletes the entire extraRewards array.
## Impact
Despite the presence of the hasRole modifier, based on the information provided by the project team:
Are the admins of the protocols your contracts integrate with (if any) TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?
RESTRICTED

If clearExtraRewards() is accidentally invoked, it could lead to the disruption of normal protocol functionality. In different scenarios:

1. For instance, within the context of _processRewards():
If addExtraReward() is permitted to add rewards but clearExtraRewards() is called, claimExtras might still be true, but relevant information about extraRewards would be missing.

2. During the period of !allowExtraRewards:
Invoking clearExtraRewards() would result in the removal of all added rewards. Even if allowExtraRewards is enabled subsequently, the restoration of these deleted rewards would be impossible.
