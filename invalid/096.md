# Potential Redundant Registration of Curve LP Tokens in `registerPool` Function
## Summary
The `registerPool` function in the contract presents a potential scenario where a Curve LP token could be registered multiple times due to the absence of duplicate registration checks. This situation might lead to inefficiencies and data duplication within the `lpTokenToUnderlying` mapping.
## Vulnerability Detail
The main purpose of the `registerPool` function is to facilitate the registration of a Curve LP token with the oracle. The function is designed to perform essential validations and populate relevant data in the `lpTokenToUnderlying` mapping. However, the function lacks checks to prevent duplicate registrations of the same `curveLpToken` address.
Here's the loop that could lead to the redundant registration issue:
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < numTokens;) {
    lpTokenToUnderlying[lpToken].push(tokens[i]);

    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```
When the function is called multiple times with the same `curveLpToken` address, this loop runs each time and appends the same tokens to the mapping, causing duplication of data.
## Impact
The impact of this situation lies in the potential inefficiencies and data redundancy caused by registering the same Curve LP token multiple times. The duplicated data might lead to confusion, consume more storage than necessary, and complicate data retrieval processes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement Duplicate Check: Before adding token addresses to the `lpTokenToUnderlying` mapping, verify whether the LP token has already been registered. If it has, prevent the duplicate registration attempt. This can be achieved by using a separate mapping or data structure to keep track of registered tokens.
