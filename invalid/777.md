# Incorrect calculation of the multiplier variable in GPToke.previewPoints()
## Summary

In general, the calculation of the multiplier variable is very strange. More:

1. When calculating the multiplier, the YEAR_BASE_BOOST variable is used. YEAR_BASE_BOOST is a constant and is equal to
uint256 private constant YEAR_BASE_BOOST = 18e17;
Most likely a mistake has been made here. Developers sealed up. Should be YEAR_BASE_BOOST = 1e17?

2. Even with YEAR_BASE_BOOST = 1e17, multiplier calculation leads to very large values. Let's see in practice.

Suppose:

amount = 2 * 1e18
duration = 1000

start=block.timestamp=1692355201

end = 1692355201 + 1000 = 1692356201

endYearpoc = (1692356201 - 1692355201) * 1e18 / 365 days = 1000 * 1e18 / 31,536,000 = 31,709,791,983,764
multiplier = pow(YEAR_BASE_BOOST, 31,709,791,983,764)

The multiplier value is very large. It is obvious that the calculation is carried out incorrectly.
