# ISyncSwapper.sol#swap() don't allow the user to provide the deadline parameter could potentially expose them to sandwich attacks.
## Summary
- Because Front-running is a key aspect of AMM design, deadline is a useful tool to ensure that your tx cannot be “saved for later”.
Due to the removal of the check, it may be more profitable for a miner to deny the transaction from being mined until the transaction incurs the maximum amount of slippage.
- Most of the functions that interact with AMM pools do not have a `deadline parameter`, but specifically the one shown below is passing `block.timestamp` to a pool, which means that whenever the miner decides to include the txn in a block, it will be valid at that time, since `block.timestamp` will be the current timestamp.
- A malicious miner can hold the transaction, which may be being done in order to free up capital to ensure that there are funds available to do operations to prevent a liquidation. It is highly likely that a liquidation is more profitable for a miner to mine, with its associated follow-on transactions, than to allow the decrease of liquidity. A miner can also just hold it until maximum slippage is incurred.
## Vulnerability Detail
- `BalancerV2Swap.sol.sol#swap()` is called by `Router` use to swap sellToken for buyToken but don't allow the user to provide the `deadline` parameter : [see here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/BalancerV2Swap.sol#L47-L65)
```solidity
    function swap(
        address,
        address sellTokenAddress,
        uint256 sellAmount,
        address buyTokenAddress,
        uint256 minBuyAmount,
        bytes memory data
    ) external override onlyRouter returns (uint256) {
        bytes32 poolId = abi.decode(data, (bytes32));


        IVault.SingleSwap memory singleSwap =
            IVault.SingleSwap(poolId, IVault.SwapKind.GIVEN_IN, sellTokenAddress, buyTokenAddress, sellAmount, "");


        IVault.FundManagement memory funds = IVault.FundManagement(address(this), false, payable(address(this)), false);


        IERC20(sellTokenAddress).safeApprove(address(vault), sellAmount);


        return vault.swap(singleSwap, funds, minBuyAmount, block.timestamp);
    }
```
- Then `vault.swap()` is called with `dealine == block.timestamp`: [see here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/interfaces/external/balancer/IVault.sol#L340-L345)
```solidity
    function swap(
        SingleSwap memory singleSwap,
        FundManagement memory funds,
        uint256 limit,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external payable returns (uint256);
```
- Passing block.timestamp as the expiry/deadline of an operation does not mean "require immediate execution" - it means "whatever block this transaction appears in, I'm comfortable with that block's timestamp". Providing this value means that a malicious miner can hold the transaction for as long as they like (think the flashbots mempool for bundling transactions), which may be until they are able to cause the transaction to incur the maximum amount of slippage allowed by the slippage parameter, or until conditions become unfavorable enough that other orders, e.g. liquidations, are triggered. Timestamps should be chosen off-chain, and should be specified by the caller to avoid unnecessary MEV.
