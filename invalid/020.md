# Inability to Revoke Extra Reward Contracts Individually in MainRewarder
## Summary

The MainRewarder contract has no way to selectively revoke access for a specific extra reward contract. This allows revoked rewards to persist indefinitely.

## Vulnerability Detail

The addExtraReward() function allows adding new extra reward contracts. However, there is no functionality to remove a specific contract, only clearExtraRewards() which resets the entire array. Extra rewards can only be added by roles with DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE privileges. It could allow significant manipulation of reward distributions if exploited.

This means revoked extra rewards remain able to distribute rewards indefinitely.

## Impact

Malicious extra rewards can exploit persisted access to manipulate rewards even if revoked at the top level.

#### Adding an extra reward:
```solidity
function addExtraReward(address reward) external hasRole(Roles.DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        if (!allowExtraRewards) {
            revert ExtraRewardsNotAllowed();
        }
        Errors.verifyNotZero(reward, "reward");

        extraRewards.push(reward);

        emit ExtraRewardAdded(reward);
    }
```

#### No way to remove a specific reward, only clear all:
```solidity
function clearExtraRewards() external hasRole(Roles.DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        delete extraRewards;

        emit ExtraRewardsCleared();
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add removeExtraReward(address reward) function to allow revoking individual extra rewards.
