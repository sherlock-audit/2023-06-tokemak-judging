# flashRebalance() doesn't pass/authenticate the receiver/initiator address
## Summary
flashRebalance() doesn't pass/authenticate the receiver/initiator address

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In LMPDebt.sol, flashRebalance() function doesn't pass the receiver. That makes it more difficult to integrate the flashRebalance() functionality.

```Solidity

    function flashRebalance(
        DestinationInfo storage destInfoOut,
        DestinationInfo storage destInfoIn,
        IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver,
        IStrategy.RebalanceParams memory params,
        FlashRebalanceParams memory flashParams,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (uint256 idle, uint256 debt) {

    //   @audit receiver authentication is missing


     // some code


>>           bytes32 flashResult = receiver.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, params.tokenIn, params.amountIn, 0, data);



     // some code


    }
```
As per eip-3156,

> A initiator will often be required in the onFlashLoan function, which the lender knows as msg.sender. An alternative implementation which would embed the initiator in the data parameter by the caller would require an additional mechanism for the receiver to verify its accuracy, and is not advisable.

As per eip-3156,

> Any receiver that keeps an approval for a given lender needs to include in onFlashLoan a mechanism to verify that the initiator is trusted.
