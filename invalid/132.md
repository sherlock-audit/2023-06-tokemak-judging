# Possible Read-Only Reentrancy Issue in `getPriceInEth` Function
## Summary
 The `getPriceInEth` function in the provided contract could potentially lead to a reentrancy attack due to its interaction with external contracts.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `getPriceInEth` function in the contract calculates the price of a token in terms of Ethereum based on data from a Curve pool and a price oracle. The function includes a check for read-only reentrancy by calling the `claim_admin_fees` function from an external contract (cryptoPool). The intention of this check is to prevent external calls that might trigger reentrancy. However, if the `claim_admin_fees` function involves external calls or improper implementation, it could introduce reentrancy vulnerabilities.
```solidity
function getPriceInEth(address token) external returns (uint256 price) {
    // ...

    // Checking for read-only reentrancy scenario.
    if (poolInfo.checkReentrancy == 1) {
        // This will fail in a reentrancy situation.
        cryptoPool.claim_admin_fees();
    }

    // ...
}
```
## Impact
An attacker could exploit this reentrancy vulnerability to maliciously call the `getPriceInEth` function and potentially manipulate the contract's state or drain its funds. The attacker could initiate an external call that invokes the `claim_admin_fees` function, triggering the reentrancy attack and allowing them to repeatedly interact with the contract before the original function call completes.

## Recommendation
Consider implementing the checks-effects-interactions pattern to mitigate the risk of reentrancy. Additionally, if possible, remove the reentrancy check from the `getPriceInEth` function altogether and rely on proper implementation.
