# the collectRewards() function is vulnerable to manipulation by a malicious liquidator
## Summary
The collectRewards() function is vulnerable to manipulation by a malicious actor with the LIQUIDATOR_ROLE
## Vulnerability Detail
The collectRewards() function is marked with the LIQUIDATOR_ROLE. This means any address that has been granted that role can call it. Inside, it simply calls the internal _collectRewards() function which returns arrays containing the reward amounts and tokens.
A malicious actor who has the LIQUIDATOR_ROLE could exploit this by:
1. Calling collectRewards() repeatedly
2. Accumulating the reward tokens
3.Draining the rewards from the contract
They can do this without actually being a liquidator or providing any service.

## Impact
Liquidator can steal funds from the protocol

Manual Review

## Recommendation
_collectRewards() should transfer the rewards directly to the protocol's treasury or beneficiary address, not back to the caller.
