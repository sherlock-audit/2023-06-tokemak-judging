# Flashloan can be used to steal reward in staking contract
## Summary

Flashloan can be used to steal reward in staking contract

## Vulnerability Detail

The GPToken staking is not transferable

the reward is calculated by the spot balance of the user

```solidity
    function _collectRewards(address user, bool distribute) internal returns (uint256) {
        // calculate user's new rewards per share (current minus claimed)
        uint256 netRewardsPerShare = accRewardPerShare - rewardDebtPerShare[user];
        // calculate amount of actual rewards
        uint256 netRewards = (balanceOf(user) * netRewardsPerShare) / REWARD_FACTOR;
```

when calling collectRewards, the reward is immediately distributed to user

the user can take the advtange of the flashloan to steal WETH reward

1. user prepare some ETH
2. user swap ETH for token
3. user call stake and lock the token with maximum duration, function stake will mint points

```solidity
// save information for current lockup
lockups[to].push(Lockup({ amount: uint128(amount), end: uint128(end), points: points }));

// create points for user
_mint(to, points);
```

4. user claim collectRewards immediately to claim WETH reward
5. user swap WETH reward back to staking token and repay the loan

all these action can happen within one transaction
