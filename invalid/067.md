# Incomplete Validation in `_verifySystemsAgree` Function
## Summary
The `_verifySystemsAgree` function in the `SystemRegistry` contract contains a vulnerability that can lead to an unexpected behavior and potentially cause reverts under certain conditions.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_verifySystemsAgree` function in the `SystemRegistry` contract contains a vulnerability due to the use of the staticcall function. As documented in Solidity, the staticcall function returns true as its first return value if the account (contract) called is non-existent. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the `_verifySystemsAgree` function.
## Impact
The vulnerability can cause the `_verifySystemsAgree` function to proceed even if the `dep` address does not correspond to a valid system-bound contract. When calling staticcall with a non-existent contract address, the function will still return true, leading to the contract continuing its execution. However, as there is no contract at the `dep` address, any attempt to access its functions or data will fail, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or reverts in subsequent parts of the contract that rely on the returned data from the non-existent contract.
