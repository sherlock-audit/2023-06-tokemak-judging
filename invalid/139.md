# Possibility of DoS in the withdraw process from Balancer
## Summary
The user requested amount in `LMPVaultRouterBase.sol.withdraw` function is not always equal to the amount of asset withdrawn from the connected balancer pool. The amount of tokens that can be withdrawn is limited by the Pool's `cash` balance, and this can cause a withdraw transaction from the user to get reverted.

## Vulnerability Detail

The user send request to withdraw 10 wETH from the `LMPVault.sol`. Assume that two `DestinationVault.sol` is connected to the `LMPVault.sol` and one of them is `BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol`.

The `BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol` can supply 30% and another one can supply 70% of requested amount from the user.

Now let's check a method from Balancer, called `getPoolTokenInfo`. this method Returns detailed information for a Pool's registered token. `cash` is the number of tokens the Vault currently holds for the Pool. `managed` is the number of tokens withdrawn and held outside the Vault by the Pool's token Asset Manager. The Pool's total balance for `token` equals the sum of `cash` and `managed`.

```solidity
    function getPoolTokenInfo(bytes32 poolId, IERC20 token)
        external
        view
        returns (
            uint256 cash,
            uint256 managed,
            uint256 lastChangeBlock,
            address assetManager
        );
```

So it's possible that tokens get withdraw and held outside the Vault and sufficient balance is not available to carry out the withdrawal process, in this case the withdrawal transaction from `BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol` cannot get done completely. finally, because there is not enough balance to process the user's withdrawal request, the transaction can get reverted in `withdraw` and `LMPVaultRouterBase.sol.redeem` methods.

## Impact
If `LMPVault.sol` needs to withdraw funds from the balancer pool, in case there is not enough balance in the balancer pool, the withdraw transaction from the user will get reverted.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe this recommendation works, Use the `getPoolTokenInfo` method to decide how much `cash` is available in the balancer pool.
