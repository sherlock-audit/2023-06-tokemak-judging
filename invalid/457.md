# The `CurveV1StableSwap` adapter allows ETH as a valid token for swaps, but the `swap` function does not handle it correctly
## Summary

The `CurveV1StableSwap` adapter allows ETH as a valid token for swaps, but the `swap` function does not handle it correctly.

## Vulnerability Detail

`CurveV1StableSwap.sol` allows ETH as a valid token for swaps, as we can see in the `isTokenMatch` function.

```solidity
76    function isTokenMatch(address fromAddress, address queriedAddress) internal view returns (bool) {
77        if (queriedAddress == LibAdapter.CURVE_REGISTRY_ETH_ADDRESS_POINTER) {
78            if (fromAddress == LibAdapter.CURVE_REGISTRY_ETH_ADDRESS_POINTER || fromAddress == address(weth)) {
79                return true;
80            }
```

However, when ETH is used in the `swap` function two issues arise.

```solidity
37    function swap(
38        address poolAddress,
39        address sellTokenAddress,
40        uint256 sellAmount,
41        address buyTokenAddress,
42        uint256 minBuyAmount,
43        bytes memory data
44    ) external override onlyRouter returns (uint256 amount) {
45        (int128 sellIndex, int128 buyIndex, bool isEth) = abi.decode(data, (int128, int128, bool));
46        ICurveV1StableSwap pool = ICurveV1StableSwap(poolAddress);
47
48        IERC20(sellTokenAddress).safeApprove(poolAddress, sellAmount);
49
50        amount = pool.exchange(sellIndex, buyIndex, sellAmount, minBuyAmount);
51
52        // The rest of the system only deals in WETH
53        if (isEth && buyTokenAddress == address(weth)) {
54            // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-eth
55            weth.deposit{ value: amount }();
56        }
57    }
```

When used as the sell token, the `safeApprove` call will fail, as ETH is not `ERC20` compliant (line 48).

When used as the buy token, the `amount` received from the swap will not be wrapped into WETH, as the `if` condition will not be met (line 53). Also, as the buy token address is used as the sell token address in the following hop, the `safeApprove` call will fail as described above.

## Impact

Swaps for `CurveV1StableSwap` involving `ETH` will fail.
