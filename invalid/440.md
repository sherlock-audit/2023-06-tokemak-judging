# flash loan attacks could manipulate the claimed reward amounts.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The main vulnerability is that the _claimRewards function trusts the earned information returned from the Maverick IReward contract without verifying it. This opens up an attack vector where an attacker could:
- Take out a flash loan for a large amount of the reward token
- Temporarily increase the earned balance for the reward token by depositing the flash loaned tokens into the rewarder contract
- Call _claimRewards which will claim the artificially inflated earned balance
- Receive the claimed reward tokens and repay the flash loan
This allows the attacker to essentially steal reward tokens. 

The key proof of concept steps would be:
A. Take out flash loan of reward tokens
B. Call reward.stake(account, flashLoanAmount)
C. Call _claimRewards
D. Receive inflated reward payout
E. Repay flash loan

## Impact
This allows the attacker to essentially steal reward tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This could be mitigated by having _claimRewards verify the earned balance by directly checking the staked balance for that account in the rewarder contract before claiming
