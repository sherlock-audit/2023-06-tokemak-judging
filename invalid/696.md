# Missing `whenNotPaused` for collectRewards function: Protocol Paused, Rewards Not.
## Summary
Rewards can be distributed even when the contract is paused.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function  collectRewards lacks `whenNotPaused` which checks if the protocol is paused or not, if paused the entry to the function will be blocked. This `whenNotPaused` modifier has been used to block `stake` , `unstake` and `extend` operations when the protocol is paused, but it doesnâ€™t make sense to allow `collectReward` function to withdraw pool rewards while the main assets were locked in the protocol.

## Impact

Malicious actors might exploit this vulnerability to drain rewards during a pause, especially if the pause was initiated due to a security breach or vulnerability, also creates inconsistencies in protocol behavior.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `whenNotPaused` modifier in `_collectRewards` function.

```solidity
-    function _collectRewards(address user, bool distribute) internal returns (uint256) {
+    function _collectRewards(address user, bool distribute) internal whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
```
