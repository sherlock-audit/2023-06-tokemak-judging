# GPToke.addWETHRewards() can be frontrun by an attacker
## Summary
GPToke distributes rewards instantly. That allows an attacker to frontrun the tx that distributes a new batch of rewards by locking their tokens just in time for the minimum stake duration. That way they can "game" the system.

## Vulnerability Detail
Rewards are distributed immediately. Whenever `addWETHRewards()` is called, `accRewardPerShare` is increased for the full amount. 

```sol
    function addWETHRewards(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(amount, "amount");

        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        Errors.verifyNotZero(supply, "supply");

        totalRewardsEarned += amount;
        accRewardPerShare += amount * REWARD_FACTOR / supply;

        emit RewardsAdded(amount);

        weth.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```

The attacker frontruns that tx, locks their funds for the minimum duration, collects their rewards, and withdraws them again as soon as the lock expires. The profitability depends on the frequency of new rewards as well as the minimum staking duration.

Traditional staking contracts, e.g. [flywheel-v2](https://github.com/fei-protocol/flywheel-v2) distribute rewards over a given period of time to prevent these kinds of exploits

## Impact
An attacker can possibly game the reward distribution.
