# Halted withdrawals due to division by zero if the value of the debt of a destination value is null but the shares balance is positive
## Summary
In `LMPDebt`, `_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn()` calculates the shares to burn of a destination vault, but does not deal with a 0 `currentDvDebtValue`. This would halt withdrawals until a rebalance call or removal of the vault from the queue. However, the attack could be triggered again.

## Vulnerability Detail
Withdrawals in the `LMPVault` withdraw the base asset from destination vaults in the withdrawal queue, [skipping a vault if the shares balance is 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L248). However, the shares balance might be bigger than 0, but the debt value [`currentDvDebtValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L253) 0, which would trigger a [division by 0 error](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L290). 

It is also possible to trigger the division by 0 if the destination vault is sitting at a loss, which could [round down the debt value to 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L275-L280).

## Impact
Temporarily halted withdrawals that could be quick fixed but could happen again later.

## Code Snippet
In `LMPDebt:_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn()`, `currentDvDebtValue` might be 0, triggering a division by 0 error:
```solidity
sharesToBurn = currentDvShares.mulDiv(maxAssetsToPull, currentDvDebtValue, Math.Rounding.Up);
```
The following test was added to `VMPVault-Withdraw.t.sol` as a POC:
```solidity
function test_POC_DoSByLeaving1ShareInADestinationVault() public {
    _accessController.grantRole(Roles.SOLVER_ROLE, address(this));
    _accessController.grantRole(Roles.LMP_FEE_SETTER_ROLE, address(this));

    // User is going to deposit 1000 asset
    _asset.mint(address(this), 1000);
    _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);
    _lmpVault.deposit(1000, address(this));

    _mockRootPrice(address(_underlyerOne), 0.8 ether);

    // Deployed 200 asset to DV1
    _underlyerOne.mint(address(this), 250);
    _underlyerOne.approve(address(_lmpVault), 250);
    _lmpVault.rebalance(
        address(_destVaultOne),
        address(_underlyerOne), // tokenIn
        250,
        address(0), // destinationOut, none when sending out baseAsset
        address(_asset), // baseAsset, tokenOut
        200
    );

    // Deploy 800 asset to DV2
    _underlyerTwo.mint(address(this), 800);
    _underlyerTwo.approve(address(_lmpVault), 800);
    _lmpVault.rebalance(
        address(_destVaultTwo),
        address(_underlyerTwo), // tokenIn
        800,
        address(0), // destinationOut, none when sending out baseAsset
        address(_asset), // baseAsset, tokenOut
        800
    );

    uint256 balBefore = _asset.balanceOf(address(this));
    vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
    emit Withdraw(address(this), address(this), address(this), 199, 199);
    uint256 assets = _lmpVault.redeem(199, address(this), address(this));
    uint256 balAfter = _asset.balanceOf(address(this));

    assertEq(assets, 199, "returned");
    assertEq(balAfter - balBefore, 199, "actual");

    vm.expectRevert(); // [FAIL. Reason: Division or modulo by 0]
    _lmpVault.redeem(10, address(this), address(this));
}
```

## Recommendation
Set `sharesToBurn` to 0 if `currentDvDebtValue` is 0, skipping the division.
