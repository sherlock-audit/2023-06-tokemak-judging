# Reward tokens will be stuck if it is the same as the base asset
## Summary

Reward tokens will be stuck if it is the same as the base asset, resulting in a loss of reward tokens for the vault shareholders.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the protocol stakes the LP tokens to external staking protocols (e.g., Convex, Aura, Maverick), the protocol will receive certain reward tokens in return. The `LiquidationRow` will first claim the reward tokens from the staking protocol. During the liquidation, it will swap the reward tokens to WETH (base asset) and queue them to the DestinationVault's mainrewarder.

There is an edge case that the reward tokens received from the staking protocol are the same as the base assets of the DV. For instance, the protocol might receive WETH as a reward.

Per the `LiquidationRow` contract, the only method to queue rewards to DV's mainrewarder is through the `LiquidationRow._performLiquidation` function. There is no other option in the `LiquidationRow` contract without calling this function.

When attempting to queue the WETH rewards to DV via the `LiquidationRow._performLiquidation`, Line 251 will always perform a swap. However, it makes no sense to swap from WETH to WETH. Two possible outcomes might occur, both of which are undesirable:

1) Since the buy token is the same as the sell token, performing a swap on most DEX will result in a revert; OR
2) In the event a swap manages to go through (very unlikely), it will incur a trading fee and slippage.

In the worst-case scenario (1st outcome), the WETH rewards will be stuck within the `LiquidatorRow` contract with no way to queue the WETH rewards to the DV.

276:             LibAdapter._approve(IERC20(params.buyTokenAddress), address(mainRewarder), amount);
277:             mainRewarder.queueNewRewards(amount);

## Impact

Rewards will be stuck within the `LiquidatorRow` contract, leading to a loss of reward tokens for the vault shareholders.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If the reward tokens queued are the same as the base asset (WETH), there is no need to perform the swap. Thus, it can be skipped.
