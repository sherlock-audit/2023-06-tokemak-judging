# PeripheryPayments#sweepToken and refundETH() are externally callable
## Summary
The `sweepToken` and `refundETH` functions in the PeripheryPayments contract are publicly accessible. As a result, anyone could potentially withdraw any tokens or Ether that have been sent to the contract by mistake or intentionally, presenting a significant security risk.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `PeripheryPayments` contract, which forms part of the `LMPVaultRouter`, includes functions that permit the extraction of assets from the contract. The `sweepToken` and `refundETH` functions allow the withdrawal of ERC20 tokens and Ether, respectively.

However, these functions are not protected by any access controls like it is done on the LMPVault contract for the `recover()` function for example. Consequently, any token or ETH left on LMPVaultRouter, LMPVaultRouterBase or PeripheryPayments will be taken by any user.

```solidity
function sweepToken(IERC20 token, uint256 amountMinimum, address recipient) public payable {
    uint256 balanceToken = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balanceToken < amountMinimum) revert InsufficientToken();

    if (balanceToken > 0) {
        token.safeTransfer(recipient, balanceToken);
    }
}

function refundETH() external payable {
    if (address(this).balance > 0) Address.sendValue(payable(msg.sender), address(this).balance);
}

```

## Impact

If tokens or Ether were to be sent to this contract either intentionally or by accident, they could be immediately withdrawn by anyone => loss of funds for user or for the protocol

## Recommendation

Add the `TOKEN_RECOVERY_ROLE` as it is done on others contracts for these functions
