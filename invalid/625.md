# Malicious users can stake into Maverick Rewarder
## Summary

Anyone to increase the debt values by staking Maverick Rewarder on behalf of Maverick DV inflating its external balance

## Vulnerability Detail

Under the hood, the `DestinationVault.debtValue` and `DestinationVault.balanceOfUnderlying` functions rely on the `externalBalance` function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L145

```solidity
File: DestinationVault.sol
145:     function debtValue() public virtual override returns (uint256 value) {
146:         value = _debtValue(balanceOfUnderlying());
147:     }
..SNIP..
122:     function balanceOfUnderlying() public view virtual override returns (uint256) {
123:         return internalBalance() + externalBalance();
124:     }
125: 
```

The `externalBalance` function retrieves the amount of LP tokens staked in Maverick's Rewarder contract.

```solidity
File: MaverickDestinationVault.sol
100:     /// @notice Get the balance of underlyer currently staked in Maverick Rewarder
101:     /// @return Balance of underlyer currently staked in Maverick Rewarder
102:     function externalBalance() public view override returns (uint256) {
103:         return maverickRewarder.balanceOf(address(this));
104:     }
```

The Maverick's Rewarder contract allows anyone to stake on behalf of others by defining the `account` parameter to the target account. Thus, malicious users can increase the number of LP tokens staked under the Maverick's DV account, increasing the `externalBalance`.

```solidity
File: RewardOpenSlim.sol
09: contract RewardOpenSlim is RewardBase {
10:     constructor(IERC20 _stakingToken, IPoolPositionAndRewardFactorySlim _rewardFactory) RewardBase(_stakingToken, _rewardFactory) {}
11: 
12:     function stake(uint256 amount, address account) external {
13:         _stake(msg.sender, amount, account);
14:     }
```

## Impact

Any internal or external parties that rely on the debt value of a destination vault to make financial decisions will be impacted. 

For instance, it was understood from the protocol team that the total debt value of a DV will be used when trimming the DVs when certain violations occur (e.g., assets trading at a discount for a certain period or slashing occur). In this case, debt values that do not accurately reflect the actual number of underlying LP tokens that the LMPVaults have deposited to the DVs will negatively affect the process, which might result in an inaccurate trimming/rebalancing process, leading to potential loss to the vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to implement an internal global counter to keep track of the total amount of underlying LP tokens staked at Maverick's Rewarder.
