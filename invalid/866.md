# Owner can shutdown LMPVault.sol but no function to undo shutdown.
## Summary
In a necessary situation, after `owner` has called the `LMPVault.sol#shutdown()` there is no function to undo shutdown making functions that use the `_shutdown` state variable unusable.

## Vulnerability Detail
`shutdown` is implemented but no way to undo the `shutdown`. 

The `LMPVault.sol#_shutdown` state variable is used in the `rebalance()` function which is in turn passed to `LMPDebt.rebalance()` function. In the LMPDebt contract, there is a check in the that reverts the transaction if `LMPVault.sol#_shutdown` is true.

```solidity
// in the LMPDebt._handleRebalanceOut() function
if (params._shutdown) {//@audit LMPVault.sol#_shutdown can be set to `true` but no function to set it back to `false`
                    revert VaultShutdown();
                }
```

## Impact
After shutdown function is called and everything is fine, there is no way to return to the state when `_shutdown` is `false` causing some functionalities permanently blocked.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function shutdown() external onlyOwner {
        _shutdown = true;//@audit no way to undo shutdown.
        emit Shutdown();
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the `undoShutdown` function for the `owner`.

```solidity
function undoShutdown() external onlyOwner {
        _shutdown = false;
        emit Shutdown();
    }
```
