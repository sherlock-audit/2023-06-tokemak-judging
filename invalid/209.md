# The users would still be allowed to `deposit` and `mint` in the LMPVault even when the LMPVault would be shutdown
## Summary
Once the LMPVault would be shutdown by the owner via the LMPVault#`shutdown()`, the users are supposed to be prohibited to `deposit` and `mint`  for the LMPVault.

However, within the LMPVault contract, there is no validation to check whether or not the LMPVault would be shutdown and there is no restriction for users to be prohibited to call the  LMPVault#`deposit()` and LMPVault##`mint()` like this:

As a result, the users would still be allowed to `deposit` and `mint`. This lead to an opportunity loss to make profits for the users. Because during the LMPVault would be shutdown, the profits, which the users expected, would not be generated. 



## Vulnerability Detail

Within the LMPVault contract, the `_shutdown` would be defined as a variable to store the status whether or not the LMPVault has been shutdown like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L89
```solidity
    /// @dev whether or not the vault has been shutdown
    bool internal _shutdown;
```

When an owner would like to shutdown a LMPVault, the owner call the LMPVault#`shutdown()`.
Within the LMPVault#`shutdown()`, `true` would be stored into the `_shutdown` variable like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L574
```solidity
    function shutdown() external onlyOwner {
        _shutdown = true;  /// @audit

        emit Shutdown();
    }
```

Within the LMPVault#`isShutdown()`, the caller can check whether or not the LMPVault would be shutdown like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L580-L582
```solidity
    function isShutdown() external view returns (bool) {
        return _shutdown;
    }
```

Once the LMPVault would be shutdown by the owner via the LMPVault#`shutdown()`, the users are supposed to be prohibited to `deposit` and `mint`  for the LMPVault.

However, within the LMPVault contract, there is no validation to check whether or not the LMPVault would be shutdown and there is no restriction for users to be prohibited to call the  LMPVault#`deposit()` and LMPVault##`mint()` like this:
- LMPVault#`deposit()`
   https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L332-L344

- LMPVault#`mint()`
   https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L382-L393

As a result, the users would still be allowed to `deposit` and `mint`. This lead to an opportunity loss to make profits for the users. Because during the LMPVault would be shutdown, the profits, which the users expected, would not be generated. 


## Impact
This lead to an opportunity loss to make profits for the users. Because during the LMPVault would be shutdown, the profits, which the users expected, would not be generated.

## Tool used
- Manual Review


## Recommendation
Within the LMPVault contract, consider adding a validation to check whether or not the LMPVault would be shutdown and there is no restriction for users to be prohibited to call the LMPVault#`deposit()` and LMPVault##`mint()` like this:
```solidity
    function deposit(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver
    ) public virtual override nonReentrant noNavChange ensureNoNavOps returns (uint256 shares) {
+       require(isShutdown() != true, "The LMPVault has been shutdown");  
        ...
```
```solidity
    function mint(
        uint256 shares,
        address receiver
    ) public virtual override nonReentrant noNavChange ensureNoNavOps returns (uint256 assets) {
+       require(isShutdown() != true, "The LMPVault has been shutdown");  
        ...
```
