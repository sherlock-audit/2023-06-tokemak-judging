# A failure in the withdrawal of one pool token will lock all the tokens
## Summary

When withdrawing assets from the pool, if the transfer of any of the pool tokens fails, it will not be possible to withdraw any of the assets from the pool. This can happen for example if cbETH blacklists either the destination vault contract address or the pool's contract address.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol is intended to interact with Curve cbETH/ETH, Curve cbETH/frxETH, and Balancer wstETH/cbETH pools.

One thing to note about [cbETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBe9895146f7AF43049ca1c1AE358B0541Ea49704#code) is that it has a blacklist mechanism that can be used to prevent transfers to and from certain addresses.

```solidity
    function transfer(address to, uint256 value)
        external
        override
        whenNotPaused
        notBlacklisted(msg.sender) ðŸ‘ˆ
        notBlacklisted(to) ðŸ‘ˆ
        returns (bool)
    {
        _transfer(msg.sender, to, value);
        return true;
    }
```

If for some reason cbETH blacklists either Tokemak's contract address or the pool's contract address, it will not be possible to withdraw cbETH from the pool. Although such a scenario seems unlikely, the regulations are in constant change and it is not far-fetched to imagine for example a scenario where the regulator asks to blacklist every address that has received ERC-20 tokens from an OFAC-sanctioned address.

Both `CurveV2FactoryCryptoAdapter` and `BalancerBeethovenAdapter` offer the capability to withdraw specific assets from the pools. However, in the current implementation, for Curve pools and non-composable Balancer pools all pool tokens are withdrawn always, and for Balancer composable pools the first token is withdrawn always. This means that if the transfer for any of the pool tokens fails, it will not be possible to withdraw any of the assets from the pool.

## Impact

If the transfer of any of the pool tokens fails, in this case it can be cbETH due to the blacklist mechanism, it will not be possible to withdraw any of the assets from the pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Create a mechanism that allows a specific role to choose which assets to withdraw from the pool so that it can be adjusted in case of a failure to withdraw a specific asset.
