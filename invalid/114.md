# BalancerAura,Maverick, and CurveConvex Destination Vault are missing slippage checks
## Summary
According to the readme : "Any on-chain interaction with the vaults should enforce their own slippage checks as they see fit." but `_burnUnderlyer` function of BalancerAura,Maverick, and CurveConvex Destination Vault are missing slippage checks by starting a process from an external function.

## Vulnerability Detail

Any user that wants to burn specified destination shares base asset can call `DestinationVault.sol#withdrawBaseAsset()`, even if in this process `withdrawBaseAsset()` should be called through LMPVault.sol or LMPVaultRouterBase.sol which check for slippage , these functions are external and allow any external user to burn shares of a vault and get base asset token of the vault which complete the functionality wanted of a withdrawal : 
```solidity
function withdrawBaseAsset(uint256 shares, address to) external returns (uint256 amount) {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(shares, "shares");

        emit BaseAssetWithdraw(shares, msg.sender, to);

        _burn(msg.sender, shares);

        // Accounts for shares that may be staked
        _ensureLocalUnderlyingBalance(shares);

        //E burn the specified amount of underlyer for the constituent tokens
        //E sell shares for amount 
        (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts) = _burnUnderlyer(shares); //E => @audit in all DestinationVaults there is no slippage check in BalancerAura/CurveConvex/Maverick

        ....// swap token logic 

        if (amount > 0) {
            IERC20(_baseAsset).safeTransfer(to, amount);
        }
    }
```
Problem on this process is that `withdrawBaseAsset()` function is calling `_burnUnderlyer()` on Maverick,BalancerAura and CurveConvex destination vault which does not check for slippage when burning vault shares : 
For example on `MaverickDestinationVault` : 
```solidity
    //E burn the specified amount of underlyer for the constituent tokens
    function _burnUnderlyer(uint256 underlyerAmount)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        returns (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts)
    {
        //E Burns PoolPosition ERC20 tokens and trasnfers resulting liquidity as A/B tokens to recipient
        //E @audit no slippage check , in the PoolPositionManager.sol there is a minTokenA and minTokenB https://etherscan.io/address/0xe7583af5121a8f583efd82767cccfeb71069d93a#code
        (uint256 sellAmountA, uint256 sellAmountB) = maverickBoostedPosition.burnFromToAddressAsReserves(address(this), address(this), underlyerAmount);

        tokens = new address[](2);
        amounts = new uint256[](2);

        tokens[0] = constituentTokens[0];
        tokens[1] = constituentTokens[1];

        amounts[0] = sellAmountA;
        amounts[1] = sellAmountB;
    }
```
This function does not check for slippage even if it's needed 

**Same happen on CurveConvexDestinationVault, BalancerAuraDestinationVault.**

Moreover the next step of `withdrawBaseAsset()` function is swapping assets received from corresponding vault for base asset which also lack slippage check 
```solidity
    function withdrawBaseAsset(uint256 shares, address to) external returns (uint256 amount) {
        _burn(msg.sender, shares);
        _ensureLocalUnderlyingBalance(shares);
        (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts) = _burnUnderlyer(shares); //E => @audit in all DestinationVaults there is no slippage check in BalancerAura/CurveConvex/Maverick
        uint256 nTokens = tokens.length;
        Errors.verifyArrayLengths(nTokens, amounts.length, "token+amounts");
        ISwapRouter swapRouter = _systemRegistry.swapRouter();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < nTokens; ++i) {
            address token = tokens[i];
            if (token == _baseAsset) {
                amount += amounts[i];
            } else {
                if (amounts[i] > 0) {
                    IERC20(token).safeApprove(address(swapRouter), amounts[i]);
                    amount += swapRouter.swapForQuote(token, amounts[i], _baseAsset, 0);
                }
            }
        }
        if (amount > 0) {
            IERC20(_baseAsset).safeTransfer(to, amount);
        }
    }
```

## Impact

Users can be frontrun and receive a worse price than expected when they initially submitted the transaction.
As there's no protection at all on this function, no minimum return amount or deadline for the trade transaction to be valid which means the trade can be delayed by miners or users congesting the network, as well as being sandwich attacked - ultimately leading to loss of user funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change access control of these functions to private or not externall callable by anyone because even if slippage is well implemented on the VaultRouter , it is better to consider adding a slippage check when there is slippage risk for future implementations/modifications or UX
