# [M-04] `notifyRewardAmount` can not be called because of wring check
## Summary

There is a chance that `notifyRewardAmount` can't be called and the whole reward system will be bricked.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `notifyRewardAmount` function is crucial for the rewards because it sets all of the important variables inside `AbstractRewarder`. `notifyRewardAmount` is called inside the `queueNewRewards` function which has the `onlyWhitelisted` modifier. However, there is a discrepancy between the comment and the actual code of the modifier:

```solidity
    /// @notice Restricts access to whitelisted addresses or holders of the liquidator role.
    modifier onlyWhitelisted() {
        if (!whitelistedAddresses[msg.sender] && !_hasRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
            revert Errors.AccessDenied();
        }
        _;
    }
```

Instead of allowing either a whitelisted address OR a user with `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` to call the function, the caller needs to be both. However, the problem is that only a user with another role - `DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` can add addresses to the whitelist.

```solidity
    function addToWhitelist(address wallet) external override hasRole(Roles.DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {}
```

This means that an address can be whitelisted but doesn't have the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` and vice versa. If the `DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` doesn't want to add the user with the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` to the whitelist or is simply compromised, the reward system will not work.

## Impact

None of the users will be able the claim any rewards because of uninitialized state variables.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the code for the `onlyWhitelisted` to be aligned with the comment above:

```diff
    /// @notice Restricts access to whitelisted addresses or holders of the liquidator role.
    modifier onlyWhitelisted() {
-        if (!whitelistedAddresses[msg.sender] && !_hasRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
+        if (!whitelistedAddresses[msg.sender] || !_hasRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
            revert Errors.AccessDenied();
        }
        _;
    }
```
