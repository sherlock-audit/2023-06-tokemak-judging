# In checkReentrancy(), Low level staticcall return value is not checked
## Summary
Low level staticcall return value is not checked 

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In BalancerUtilities.sol, checkReentrancy() function is used to verify reentrancy to the Balancer Vault.

```Solidity
File: v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/libs/BalancerUtilities.sol

    function checkReentrancy(address balancerVault) external view {
        // solhint-disable max-line-length
        // https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/90f77293fef4b8782feae68643c745c754bac45c/pkg/pool-utils/contracts/lib/VaultReentrancyLib.sol
        (, bytes memory returnData) = balancerVault.staticcall(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IVault.manageUserBalance.selector, new IVault.UserBalanceOp[](0))
        );
        if (keccak256(returnData) == REENTRANCY_ERROR_HASH) {
            revert BalancerVaultReentrancy();
        }
    }
```

Now check this line in checkReentrancy() function,

```Solidity
        (, bytes memory returnData) = balancerVault.staticcall(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IVault.manageUserBalance.selector, new IVault.UserBalanceOp[](0))
        );
```

It does not check boolean success. Low-level .staticcall() doesn't revert in caller's context when the callee reverts. If its return value is not checked, it can lead the caller to falsely believe that the call was successful. 

By adding the require statement the contract will revert and throw an exception with the specified error message if the external call was not successful. This helps to ensure that the contract state remains consistent and avoids potential issues caused by failed executions.

Another issue here is the low level staticcall does not check the balancerVault code existence. Per solidity documentation, 

![low level call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-gfx-judging/assets/112799398/0d325650-7893-41ea-a570-a786c3247266)

The Solidity documentation further warns:
**"The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed."**

code existence must be checked especially for low level functions like call,staticcall and delegatecall.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Check the low level boolean success return value
2) check code existence for low level calls

For example:
See [isComposablePool() which has also used low level staticcall()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/libs/BalancerUtilities.sol#L37)
