# [M-03]No zero address check in LMPVault::setRewarder() which can lead to loss of funds.
## Summary

There is no check to see if the passed in address of rewarder is zero address, which can cause loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [LMPVault.sol()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L283C4-L297C6) there is no check to see if the passed in address of rewarder is zero address. There is a check to see if the rewarder is already set or not. But lacks zero address check.

## Impact

If rewarder is set to zero address by mistake or forcefully, this would cause all the funds to be send to that address and can never be taken back. Very low likelihood but impact is high, so severity should be medium.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
function setRewarder(address _rewarder) external {
        if (msg.sender != factory) {
            revert Errors.AccessDenied();
        }

        Errors.verifyNotZero(_rewarder, "rewarder");

        if (address(rewarder) != address(0)) {
            revert RewarderAlreadySet();
        }

        rewarder = IMainRewarder(_rewarder);

        emit RewarderSet(_rewarder);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set zero address check:
```javascript
if(_rewarder == address(0)){
revert RewarderCannotBeZeroAddress();
```
