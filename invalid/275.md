# Oracles Unvalidated in External Contract Interaction
## Summary
 the assumption that the external contract will behave as expected and return accurate data., this assumption is risky, as external contracts can be manipulated or compromised, leading to incorrect data being returned. In the code, the result of the swap amountReceived is used in further calculations without verifying its accuracy. and If a malicious asyncSwapper provides incorrect data, the liquidation process could lead to financial losses.
## Vulnerability Detail

see summary 
the vulnerable part in code :

```solidity
 /**
     * @notice Conducts the liquidation process for a specific token across a list of vaults,
     * performing the necessary balance adjustments, initiating the swap process via the asyncSwapper,
     * taking a fee from the received amount, and queues the remaining swapped tokens in the MainRewarder associated
     * with
     * each vault.
     * @dev This function calls the _prepareForLiquidation and _performLiquidation functions. These helper functions
     * were created to avoid a "stack too deep" error. These functions should only be used within the context of this
     * function.
     * @param fromToken The token that needs to be liquidated
     * @param asyncSwapper The address of the async swapper contract
     * @param vaultsToLiquidate The list of vaults that need to be liquidated
     * @param params Parameters for the async swap
     */
    function liquidateVaultsForToken(
        address fromToken,
        address asyncSwapper,
        IDestinationVault[] memory vaultsToLiquidate,
        SwapParams memory params
    ) external nonReentrant hasRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE) onlyWhitelistedSwapper(asyncSwapper) {
        uint256 gasBefore = gasleft();

        (uint256 totalBalanceToLiquidate, uint256[] memory vaultsBalances) =
            _prepareForLiquidation(fromToken, vaultsToLiquidate);
        _performLiquidation(
            gasBefore, fromToken, asyncSwapper, vaultsToLiquidate, params, totalBalanceToLiquidate, vaultsBalances
        );
    }

    /**
     * @notice Calculates the total balance to liquidate, adjusts the contract state accordingly and calculates fees
     * @dev This function is part of a workaround for the "stack too deep" error and is meant to be used with
     * _performLiquidation. It is not designed to be used standalone, but as part of the liquidateVaultsForToken
     * function
     * @param fromToken The token that needs to be liquidated
     * @param vaultsToLiquidate The list of vaults that need to be liquidated
     * @return totalBalanceToLiquidate The total balance that needs to be liquidated
     * @return vaultsBalances The balances of the vaults
     */    
```

- The code trusts the amountReceived value returned by the asyncSwapper contract without further verification.
- Malicious actors could manipulate the asyncSwapper contract to always report a higher amountReceived than the actual value, leading to overestimation of rewards.
## Impact
If a malicious asyncSwapper contract reports higher amounts than what's actually received, the liquidation process would transfer more tokens to the liquidator than deserved. This could lead to financial losses for other users and potential confusion about the actual liquidation rewards.
Here is a Valid Scenario :
- the attacker deploys a malicious asyncSwapper contract.
- The malicious contract always reports an amountReceived value that's 10% higher than the actual amount.
- The contract owner calls liquidateVaultsForToken using the malicious asyncSwapper.
- The attacker receives 10% more tokens than they should due to the manipulated amountReceived.
