# First deposit bug can be traced in `LMPVault._convertToAssets`
## Summary

First deposit bug can be traced in `LMPVault._convertToAssets`

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    /// @dev Internal conversion function (from shares to assets) with support for rounding direction.
    function _convertToAssets(uint256 shares, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 assets) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        assets = (supply == 0) ? shares : shares.mulDiv(totalAssets(), supply, rounding);
    }
```

Here it looks like the exchange rate is dependent upon the ratio of totalSupply and token balance of asset/share token contracts, the attacker can craft transactions to manipulate the exchange rate.

The attacker could do a plain underlying token transfer to the contract, artificially inflating the balanceOf value, and thus rob the user who is first to deposit.

Please take a look at this bug from Ondo Finance report where it is elaborated much clearly:

## Impact

Loss of tokens for initial users.

```solidity
    /// @dev Internal conversion function (from shares to assets) with support for rounding direction.
    function _convertToAssets(uint256 shares, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 assets) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        assets = (supply == 0) ? shares : shares.mulDiv(totalAssets(), supply, rounding);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Deposit some amount (1 wei), prior to someone else does, so certain users cannot manipulate the pool. There could be better a mitigation that I'm unaware of.
