# `CurveConvexDestinationVault` has a `receive` function but no way to use/retrieve received ETH
## Summary

CurveConvexDestinationVault.sol contains a payable `receive` function but no means of retrieving ether from the contract. This means that any ETH sent to the contract will be trapped.

## Vulnerability Detail

Natspec states that the `receive` function is included to "support ETH operations", however this is not the case as this empty function is the only way to transfer ETH to the contract, and there is no way to retrive it.

79:     ///@notice Support ETH operations
80:     receive() external payable { }
```

## Impact

Trapped funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either add the intended ETH functionality to the vault contract, add a sweep ether function, or remove the `receive` function to prevent accidental transfers.
