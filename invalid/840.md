# Hardcoded Timeout Value in BaseOracleDenominations.sol Leads to Inaccurate Timeout Settings for Different Price Feeds
## Summary

The hardcoded [DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT ](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/oracles/providers/base/BaseOracleDenominations.sol#L22) in `BaseOracleDenominations.sol` contract may result in the system timing out constantly between heartbeats for price feeds with longer heartbeat durations. This approach is considered bad practice. Can find the Heartbeat duration of Chainlink Data Feeds [Here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses)

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
File: src/oracles/providers/base/BaseOracleDenominations.sol
22  uint256 public constant DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT = 2 hours;
```

hardcoded DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT  can be problematic especially for pricefeed with longer heartbeat durations, as the system may timeout consistently between heartbeats. Using the same DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT  value for all price feeds, regardless of their individual heartbeat durations, is not optimal or safe
## Impact

The impact of this issue could lead to constant system timeouts between heartbeats for price feeds that have longer heartbeat durations. This may result in data fetching failures or unnecessary system delays

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider refactoring the a mapping to store to include the heartbeat duration for each price feed
or find another way to prevent constant timeouts for each pricefeeds
