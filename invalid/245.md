## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 for (uint256 i ; i < totalLength; ++i) {
            // Using the totalSupply check to represent stash tokens. They sometimes
            // stand in as the rewardToken but they don't have a "balanceOf()"
            if (IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).totalSupply() > 0) {
                balancesBefore[i] = IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).balanceOf(account);
            }
