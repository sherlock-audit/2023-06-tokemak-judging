# Undercollateralized LMPVault breaks `deposit` and mints unlimited tokens for free
## Summary

When the LMPVault is undercollateralized, some functions will not work as expected, which causes the `deposit` function not to work and allows users to mint shares for free and bypass the total supply limit and the limit per wallet.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `LMPVault.sol` there is a function `_isVaultCollateralized` that is used to check if the vault shares are backed by assets, returning `false` in the case that the total assets are 0 and the total supply is higher than 0.

```solidity
623    ///@dev Checks if vault is "healthy" in the sense of having assets backing the circulating shares.
624    function _isVaultCollateralized() internal view returns (bool) {
625        return totalAssets() > 0 || totalSupply() == 0;
626    }
```

This scenario can be caused by different reasons, such as the assets deployed to the destination vault being lost due to a bug or a hack in the destination contract, the value of the assets dropping to zero for an issue in the oracle, or a real loss of value.

In such case, the protocol will not function as expected in the following ways:

#### 1) `deposit` will revert

The `deposit` function has a `noNavChange` modifier that reverts if there is a change in the NAV of the vault during the execution of the function. This modifier skips the check in case the total supply is zero, but not in the case the total assets are zero. So in the case the total assets are zero and the total supply is higher than zero, the NAV will change and the `deposit` functions will revert.

#### 2) Users will mint shares for free

The calculation for the number of assets that are required to mint some amount of shares is as follows:

```solidity
595    function _convertToAssets(uint256 shares, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 assets) {
596        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
597        assets = (supply == 0) ? shares : shares.mulDiv(totalAssets(), supply, rounding);
598    }
```

In the case, the total assets are zero, but the total supply is not, the calculation will return 0 for any amount of shares, so users will be able to mint shares for free.

#### 3) Total supply limit and limit per wallet can be bypassed

In the `_maxMint` function we find the following code:

```solidity
931        if (!_isVaultCollateralized()) {
932            return Math.min(tsLimit, walletLimit);
933        }
```

This means that the amount of shares already existing is ignored and the max amount of shares can be minted in any new transaction. Combining this issue with the previous one means that users are able to mint shares for free without any limit.


## Impact

In the case of the vault being uncollateralized:
- The `deposit` function will revert, making it impossible to deposit new assets to the vault.
- The `mint` function will mint shares for free without any limit. In the case of the `totalDebt` recovering to a positive value (for example, due to the value of the assets increasing, assets in the destination being recovered, oracle issue being resolved, etc), the users that had minted shares for free will be able to redeem most of the assets in the vault, as they were able to mint much more shares than the total supply limit and the wallet limit.
