# Missing Stat Calculators for certain LST
## Summary

Stat Calculator was observed to be missing for some of the supported LSTs

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the contest's README, the following list of LST is supported. However, it was observed that there are missing stat calculators for some LSTs.

| Support LST Per README | Stat Calculator    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| stETH                  | StethLSTCalculator |
| wstETH                 | Not Found          |
| rETH                   | RethLSTCalculator  |
| cbETH                  | CbethLSTCalculator |
| frxETH                 | Not Found          |
| sfrxETH                | Not Found          |
| swETH                  | SwethLSTCalculator |

## Impact

Without a stat calculator for the LST, the strategy might have difficulty determining the performance of the tokens and making accurate decisions during rebalancing, potentially resulting in unprofitable rebalancing being executed.
