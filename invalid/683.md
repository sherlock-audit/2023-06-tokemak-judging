# Malicious user can make LMPDebt._calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn always think that the destination vault is currently sitting at a loss, causing the user who calls deposit/redeem to revert or lose funds
## Summary

When users want to withdraw funds via `deposit`/`redeem`, If not enough funds in `totalIdle`, then pull what user need from destination vaults. [[_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L231)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L231) is used to calculate the number of shares of the destination vault that will be burned. This function internally checks whether the destination vault is in profit or loss. If at a loss, they can only burn an amount proportional to their ownership of this LMPVault.

Malicious users can make `_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn` mistakenly think that the destination vault is always at a loss.Â This will make the funds pulled far from enough, which will bring the following impacts:

1.  Users who call deposit/redeem may be forever reverted due to slippage protection.
2.  Reverting all the time may cause users to fear and give up slippage protection. The funds withdrawn are far less than the expected amount. User suffers loss of funds.
3.  The user withdraws less funds, which means more funds per share. Malicious users make profit indirectly.

231:     function _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
......
245:         uint256 currentDvShares = destVault.balanceOf(address(this));
......
252:         // Calculate the current value of our shares
253:         uint256 currentDvDebtValue = destVault.debtValue(currentDvShares);
254: 
255:         // Get the basis for the current deployment
256:->       uint256 cachedDebtBasis = destInfo.debtBasis;
257: 
258:         // The amount of shares we had at the last debt reporting
259:->       uint256 cachedDvShares = destInfo.ownedShares;
260: 
261:         // The value of our debt + earned rewards at last debt reporting
262:         uint256 cachedCurrentDebt = destInfo.currentDebt;
......
271:         // Recalculated what the debtBasis is with the current number of shares
272:->       uint256 updatedDebtBasis = cachedDebtBasis.mulDiv(currentDvShares, cachedDvShares, Math.Rounding.Up);
273:         
274:         // Neither of these numbers include rewards from the DV
275:->       if (currentDvDebtValue < updatedDebtBasis) {
276:             // We are currently sitting at a loss. Limit the value we can pull from
277:             // the destination vault
278:->           currentDvDebtValue = currentDvDebtValue.mulDiv(userShares, totalVaultShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
279:->           currentDvShares = currentDvShares.mulDiv(userShares, totalVaultShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
280:         }
......
296:     }
```

When the `if` condition of L275 is met, it means that `destVault` is at a loss. L278-279 will scale down `currentDvDebtValue` and `currentDvShares` in proportion to `userShares/totalVaultShares`. How to make `currentDvDebtValue < updatedDebtBasis`?

L245, get the `currentDvShares` of destVault held by this.

L253, call `destVault.debtValue(currentDvShares)` to get the `currentDvDebtValue` of these shares.

L256, `cachedDebtBasis = destInfo.debtBasis`, this value is a cache and is only updated when `rebalance`/`flashRebalance`.

L259, `cachedDvShares = destInfo.ownedShares`, this value is a cache, anyone can update `destInfo.ownedShares` to `destVault.balanceOf(address(this))` via `updateDebtReporting`.

L272, `updatedDebtBasis = cachedDebtBasis.mulDiv(currentDvShares, cachedDvShares, Math.Rounding.Up)`, **the problem is here**. If `currentDvShares=cachedDvShares` (as mentioned above, `cachedDvShares` can be updated to `destVault.balanceOf(address(this))`, which is `currentDvShares`), then `updatedDebtBasis = cachedDebtBasis`.

L275, since `updatedDebtBasis` of L272 can always be equal to `cachedDebtBasis`, `currentDvDebtValue` is calculated based on the current shares, and `cachedDebtBasis` is calculated based on the shares at that time during the latest rebalancing. Malicious users only need to withdraw some shares in advance so that `currentDvDebtValue < cachedDebtBasis`.

When the `sharesToBurn` returned by `_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn` is very small, it is likely that the following `for` loop will not get the expected `info.totalAssetsToPull` after traversing all the target vaults.

```solidity
File: v2-core-audit-2023-07-14\src\vault\LMPVault.sol
448:     function _withdraw(
449:         uint256 assets,
450:         uint256 shares,
451:         address receiver,
452:         address owner
......
464:         // If not enough funds in idle, then pull what we need from destinations
465:         if (info.totalAssetsToPull > 0) {
466:             uint256 totalVaultShares = totalSupply();
467: 
468:             // Using pre-set withdrawalQueue for withdrawal order to help minimize user gas
469:             uint256 withdrawalQueueLength = withdrawalQueue.length;
470:             for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawalQueueLength; ++i) {
471:                 IDestinationVault destVault = IDestinationVault(withdrawalQueue[i]);
472:->               (uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) = _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
473:                     destVault,
474:                     shares,
475:                     info.totalAssetsToPull - Math.max(info.debtDecrease, info.totalAssetsPulled),
476:                     totalVaultShares
477:                 );
478:                 if (sharesToBurn == 0) {
479:                     continue;
480:                 }
482:                 uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
483:->               uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));//The smaller sharesToBurn, the smaller assetPulled.
484: 
485:                 // Destination Vault rewards will be transferred to us as part of burning out shares
486:                 // Back into what that amount is and make sure it gets into idle
487:                 info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
488:                 info.totalAssetsPulled += assetPulled;
489:                 info.debtDecrease += totalDebtBurn;
......
505:             }
506:         }
......
538:     }
```

L472, `sharesToBurn` will be small (depending on `shares/totalVaultShares`), since destVault is considered to be in loss.

L483, since `sharesToBurn` is small, `assetPulled` is also small.

After the `for` loop exits, the total funds pulled may be smaller than the user's desired funds. Then tx will revert due to slippage protection. Always revert, users will inevitably reduce the funds they expect to get. So user will suffer loss of funds. This also indirectly increases the funds per share, opening up profit opportunities for malicious users.

Malicious users can achieve this goal by following the steps below.

1.  After each rebalance, trigger the withdrawal of funds via `deposit`/`redeem`.
    
2.  Call `updateDebtReporting` to [make the destination vault update `destInfo.ownedShares` to `destVault.balanceOf(address(this))`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L780-L783).
    

Repeat steps 1 and 2 to make all destVaults in the withdrawalQueue be in 'fake' loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add `uint256 shareBasis` for `DestinationInfo`.

1.  Add `destInfo.shareBasis = currentShares` in [[L445](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L445)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L445).
2.  [[L272](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L272)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L272) is changed to `uint256 updatedDebtBasis = cachedDebtBasis.mulDiv(currentDvShares, destInfo.shareBasis, Math.Rounding.Up)`.
