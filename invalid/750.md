# Swap Router do not use valid deadlines for operations
## Summary

Not allowing users to supply their own deadline could potentially expose them to sandwich attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: UniV3Swap.sol

  IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
        path: data,
        recipient: address(this),
        deadline: block.timestamp, // @audit-issue No valid Deadline
        amountIn: sellAmount,
        amountOutMinimum: minBuyAmount
    });

```

AMMs provide their users with an option to limit the execution of their pending actions, such as swaps or adding and removing liquidity. The most common solution is to include a deadline timestamp as a parameter (for example in Uniswap V2 and Uniswap V3). If such an option is not present, users can unknowingly perform bad trades as interaction with the pools is very time sensitive, if transaction gets hold for sometime than it can lead to bad trades unknowingly by the Users and can potentially result in loss of funds.

All the functions in the codebase that interact with uniswap pools have a deadline parameter passed as `block.timestamp`, which means that whenever the miner decides to include the transaction in a block, it will be valid at that time, since `block.timestamp` will be the current timestamp at the time of mining. but here, there is a possibility of a malicious miner to hold the transaction how whatever amount he/she wants.

This is the reason, instead of `block.timestamp`, an extra arguments should be passed with the functions and user should be allowed to pass a valid deadline for it so that in case a malicious miner tries to hold it, then the transaction reverts as per the deadline specified by the user. Having slippage is an issue for any AMMs but having outdated Slippage protection can also be a dangerous attack vector.

## Impact

Loss of Funds for Users because of stale slippage protection

## Recommendation

Add deadline arguments in all functions that interact with uniswap pools, and pass it along to these calls.
