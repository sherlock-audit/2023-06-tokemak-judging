# First depositor can steal asset tokens of others
## Summary
ERC4626 vaults are subject to a share price manipulation attack that allows an attacker to steal underlying tokens from other depositors.


## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol:
  586       */
  587:     function _convertToShares(uint256 assets, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
  588:         uint256 supply = totalSupply();
  589: 
  590:         // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
  591:         shares = (assets == 0 || supply == 0) ? assets : assets.mulDiv(supply, totalAssets(), rounding);
  592:     }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
[Uniswap V2 solved this problem by sending the first 1000 LP tokens to the zero address](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L124). The same can be done in this case i.e. when totalSupply() == 0, send the first min liquidity LP tokens to the zero address to enable share dilution.

Ensure the number of shares to be minted is non-zero: require(shares != 0, "zero shares minted");

Create a periphery contract that contains a wrapper function that atomically calls initialize() and deposit()

Call deposit() once in initialize() to achieve the same effect as the suggestion above.
