# Timing-Dependent Exposure in `claimRewards` function
## Summary
The `claimRewards` function in the `BeethovenRewardsAdapter` contract is susceptible to front-running attacks due to the way it calculates balances before claiming rewards. Attackers can monitor these balance calculations on the blockchain and manipulate the price of reward tokens before the contract claims its rewards, potentially gaining an unfair financial advantage.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `claimRewards` function within the `BeethovenRewardsAdapter` contract interacts with the Beethoven protocol to claim rewards from a specified gauge. Here's a breakdown of how the vulnerability is introduced:
1. The function begins by fetching the current balances of reward tokens for the contract's address using the `balancesBefore` array. This calculation is performed publicly on-chain, allowing external parties to observe the balances that are about to be claimed.
2. Attackers can monitor the blockchain for changes in the contract's reward token balances. When they notice an increase in a specific reward token's balance, they can infer that the contract is about to claim rewards for that token.
3. By executing transactions just before the contract claims its rewards, attackers can manipulate the price of the targeted reward token in their favor. This manipulation can involve buying or selling significant amounts of the reward token to artificially influence its price.

## Impact
The potential impact of this vulnerability is that attackers can profit by front-running the contract's reward claiming transactions. By manipulating the price of reward tokens, attackers can buy tokens at artificially low prices or sell tokens at artificially high prices, resulting in financial gains at the expense of other users.

## Recommendation
`Secure Off-Chain Balance Calculation`: Instead of calculating reward token balances on-chain within the `claimRewards` function, calculate these balances off-chain and submit the calculated values to the contract. By keeping the balance calculations private until the moment of reward claiming, you prevent attackers from observing the balances and timing their transactions to manipulate prices.
