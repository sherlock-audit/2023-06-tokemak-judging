# The withdraw function in VaultRouter does not have approval for shares of the users
## Summary
The withdraw function in VaultRouter does not have approval for shares of the users 
So LMPVault can't burn the shares of the users. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When the user invokes [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L73-L90) from `LMPVaultRouter.sol`
the `msg.sender` in `LMPVault._withdraw()` will be the VaultRouter and in this block **LMPVault** is checking the allowance

```solidity
File: LMPVault.sol
521:         // do the actual withdrawal (going off of total # requested)
522:         uint256 allowed = allowance(owner, msg.sender);
523:         if (msg.sender != owner && allowed != type(uint256).max) {
524:             if (shares > allowed) revert AmountExceedsAllowance(shares, allowed);
525: 
526:             unchecked {
527:                 _approve(owner, msg.sender, allowed - shares);
528:             }
529:         }

```
and because [off-chain users withdrawal flow should always start at the LMPVaultRouter which forces an account for slippage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/README.md#on-chain-swappers)

this is the logic of `withdraw()` which is not setting any approval to the VaultRouter 

```solidity
File: LMPVaultRouterBase.sol
73:     function withdraw(
74:         ILMPVault vault,
75:         address to,
76:         uint256 amount,
77:         uint256 maxSharesOut,
78:         bool unwrapWETH
79:     ) public virtual override returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
80:         address destination = unwrapWETH ? address(this) : to;
81: 
82:         sharesOut = vault.withdraw(amount, destination, msg.sender);
83:         if (sharesOut > maxSharesOut) {
84:             revert MaxSharesError();
85:         }
86: 
87:         if (unwrapWETH) {
88:             _processWethOut(to);
89:         }
90:     }

```

## Impact
- the withdraw function in VaultRouter always revert with `AmountExceedsAllowance`
- users are not able to withdraw from VaultRouter. this will force them to withdraw directly from LMPVault with no slippage protaction

80:         address destination = unwrapWETH ? address(this) : to;
+ 81:     approve(IERC20(vault), address(this), amount);
