# Attacker can extract value from protocol during extreme price crash as ChainlinkOracle.getPriceInEth() doesn't check answer > minAnswer
## Summary
Attacker can extract value from protocol during extreme price crash as ChainlinkOracle.getPriceInEth() doesn't check answer > minAnswer.

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink price feeds have in-built minimum & maximum prices they will return; if during a flash crash, bridge compromise or depegging event an asset's value falls below the price feed's minimum price, the oracle price feed will continue to report the (now incorrect) minimum price. An attacker could use this to extract value from the protocol.

In such an event, an attacker could:

* buy the asset using a decentralized exchange at the very low price,
* deposit the asset into the protocol as collateral,
* borrow against the collateral asset at the minimum price Chainlink's price feed returns, even though the actual price is far lower,
* optional - swap the borrowed asset to their token of choice, typically DAI or ETH (something where funds can't be frozen).
* allow their collateral asset to be liquidated since it is worth far less than the protocol believes.

## Impact
An attacker could use this to extract value from the protocol.
