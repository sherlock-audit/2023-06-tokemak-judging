# Call to IExtraRewarder(extraRewards[i]) in _processRewards can be maliciously attacked
## Summary
When adding a new extra rewarder via addExtraReward, there is no verification that the contract implements IExtraRewarder. An attacker could add a malicious contract and exploit the call to IExtraRewarder(extraRewards[i]) in _processRewards
## Vulnerability Detail
The key issue is that addExtraReward() does not verify that the reward contract added implements IExtraRewarder [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L52-L61) later in _processRewards(), it assumes the contract is a valid IExtraRewarder [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L108-L118C1)
An attacker could exploit this by:
- Deploying a malicious contract that does NOT implement IExtraRewarder
- Calling addExtraReward() to add the malicious contract
- The malicious contract would be called via IExtraRewarder(extraRewards[i])
- The malicious contract could execute arbitrary logic, steal funds, etc.
## Impact
The malicious contract could execute arbitrary logic, steal funds, etc.

## Recommendation
Ensure addExtraReward()  verifies that the contract added implements IExtraRewarder:
