# Rounding Error in addWETHRewards Function Can Lock WETH
## Summary
The `addWETHRewards` function in the smart contract allows actors to deposit `WETH` as staking rewards. However, due to the way rewards are distributed among stakers, small `WETH` deposits can result in `accRewardPerShare` rounding down to zero. This can lead to locked `WETH` in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the calculation of `accRewardPerShare` in the `addWETHRewards` function. The formula used is `amount * REWARD_FACTOR / supply`. If the amount of WETH deposited is too small relative to the supply, the result of the division can round down to zero. This means that the deposited WETH will not be distributed among stakers and will remain locked in the contract.

## Impact
Stakers will not receive their fair share of rewards for small WETH deposits. Over time, this can accumulate and result in a significant amount of WETH being locked in the contract, inaccessible to both the stakers and the contract owner.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You could accumulate small deposits until they reach a certain threshold and then distribute them. Another solution could be to use a more precise arithmetic library or increase the precision of the calculations to ensure that rounding issues are minimized.
