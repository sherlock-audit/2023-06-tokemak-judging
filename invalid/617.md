# Malicious users can stake into Aura on behalf of Balancer DV inflating its external balance
## Summary

Anyone to increase the debt values by staking into the Aura on behalf of the Balancer's destination vault to increase its external balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

Under the hood, the `DestinationVault.debtValue` and `DestinationVault.balanceOfUnderlying` functions rely on the `externalBalance` function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L145

```solidity
File: DestinationVault.sol
145:     function debtValue() public virtual override returns (uint256 value) {
146:         value = _debtValue(balanceOfUnderlying());
147:     }
..SNIP..
122:     function balanceOfUnderlying() public view virtual override returns (uint256) {
123:         return internalBalance() + externalBalance();
124:     }
125: 
```

The `externalBalance` function retrieves the amount of LP tokens staked in the Aura's Rewarder contract.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol#L119

```solidity
File: BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol
116: 
117:     /// @notice Get the balance of underlyer currently staked in Aura
118:     /// @return Balance of underlyer currently staked in Aura
119:     function externalBalance() public view override returns (uint256) {
120:         return IERC20(auraStaking).balanceOf(address(this));
121:     }
```

Although Aura is forked from Convex, it is important to note that there are some slight differences between them. 

Aura supports a deposit function, as shown below in their reward contract, that allows anyone to stake on behalf of others. This was not supported in Convex. Thus, malicious users can increase the number of LP tokens staked under the Balancer's DV account, increasing the `externalBalance`.

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public virtual override nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    // Transfer "asset" (crvLP) from sender
    IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

    // Convert crvLP to cvxLP through normal booster deposit process, but don't stake
    uint256 balBefore = stakingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    IDeposit(operator).deposit(pid, assets, false);
    uint256 balAfter = stakingToken.balanceOf(address(this));

    require(balAfter.sub(balBefore) >= assets, "!deposit");

    // Perform stake manually, now that the funds have been received
    _processStake(assets, receiver);

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, assets);
    emit Staked(receiver, assets);
    return assets;
}
```

## Impact

Any internal or external parties that rely on the debt value of a destination vault to make financial decisions will be impacted. 

For instance, it was understood from the protocol team that the total debt value of a DV will be used when trimming the DVs when certain violations occur (e.g., assets trading at a discount for a certain period or slashing occur). In this case, debt values that do not accurately reflect the actual number of underlying LP tokens that the LMPVaults have deposited to the DVs will negatively affect the process, which might result in an inaccurate trimming/rebalancing process, leading to potential loss to the vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to implement an internal global counter to keep track of the total amount of underlying LP tokens staked at external staking protocol (e.g., Aura, Convex).
