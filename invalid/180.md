# missing `payable` keyword on some external functions causes inability to work and receive ETH, making withdrawals impossible on curve destination vaults.
## Summary
The funds transfer flow from `DestinationVaults.withdrawBaseAsse()` --> `swapRouter.swapForQuote()` --> `CurveV1StableSwap.swap()` neglects the fact that the asset can be ETH for CURVE DESTINATION VAULTS.

1.  in CurveV1StableSwap.swap(), ETH will be wrapped to WETH whenever `bool isETH` is true and buyTokenAddress == `WETH`. but the function lacks the `payable` keyword therefore it's unable to receive ETH. take a look [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/CurveV1StableSwap.sol#L52-L56)


2. missing payable keyword on swapRouter.swapForQuote() will always revert DestinationVaults.withdrawBaseAsset()  for **curve destination vaults**, because swapRouter.swapForQuote() is unable to receive ETH as it lacks the `payable` keyword  and  curve destination vaults handle ETH directly and swap it for WETH on withdrawal [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L260-L276)

3. there's no payable keyword on `address(this)` when transferring the token to be swapped which could be ETH for **curve destination vaults** see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/SwapRouter.sol#L83)
since the token can be ETH, this will always cause reverts when withdrawing for users, making it impossible to withdraw on **curve destination vaults**. So i think it's a high severity.

Also i don't think `safeTransferFrom()` method is the best way to send ETH, .call() method could have been used instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. The missing payable keyword on CurveV1StableSwap.swap() makes it unable to receive ETH. 

2. swapRouter.swapForQuote() lacks the payable keyword too and therefore it's unable to receive ETH from DestinationVaults.withdrawBaseAsset(). This issue is only applicable for **curve destination vaults**,  because they handle ETH directly and swap it for WETH on withdrawal.

3. `address payable` and `address` are not the same thing, `address payable`  is used on addresses that are supposed to receive ETH but `address` type can't receive ETH. So since there's no payable keyword on `address(this)` when transferring the token to be swapped which could be ETH for **curve destination vaults**, there will always be reverts when withdrawing for users.
Also i don't think `safeTransferFrom()` method is the best way to send ETH, .call() method could have been used instead.


## Impact
Withdrawals on Curve Destination Vaults might always revert due to missing `payable` keyword.

## Tool used

Lofi Radio and Manual Review

## Recommendation
put payable keyword on CurveV1StableSwap.swap() and swapRouter.swapForQuote() and also add payable to `address(this)` to avoid reverts  [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/SwapRouter.sol#L83)
```solidity
-            IERC20(assetToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), sellAmount);
+            IERC20(assetToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, payable(address(this)), sellAmount);
```

Also i'm not so sure that this is the best way to send ETH, maybe use .call() method
