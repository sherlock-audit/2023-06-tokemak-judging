# GPToke.sol#L183C14-L183C27 : previewPoints : Hardcoded number of days in epoch calculation is incorrect.
## Summary

In [previewPoints](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L183C14-L183C27),  365 days is used in the epoch duration calculation. But this is lesser than the actual epoch duration for a year.

## Vulnerability Detail

GToke contract has the [previewPoints](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L183C14-L183C27) function which is used to calculate the total points and the end time for a stake.

This function is used in [stake ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L107) and in [extend ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L170)the stake.

```solidity
    function previewPoints(uint256 amount, uint256 duration) public view returns (uint256 points, uint256 end) {
        if (duration < minStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooShort();
        if (duration > maxStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooLong();


        // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
        uint256 start = block.timestamp > startEpoch ? block.timestamp : startEpoch;
        end = start + duration;


        // calculate points based on duration from staking end date
        uint256 endYearpoc = ((end - startEpoch) * 1e18) / 365 days; ---------------->> hard coded number of days.
        uint256 multiplier = PRBMathUD60x18.pow(YEAR_BASE_BOOST, endYearpoc);


        points = (amount * multiplier) / 1e18;
    }
```

In a year, there are 365.24 days.

1 year (365.24 days) | 31556926 seconds

But for 365 days, the total number of seconds : 31536000

The difference is = 20962 seconds ~6 hours.

## Impact

Since 365 is used in denominator, the calculated points would be higher than the actual value.

In total, more number of points are awarded for stake . This would  be loss to the protocol.

For single user it would be 5 hours. But lets say there are 1000 members stake, the total time would be 6000 hours. This will be huge.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of hardcoded 365 days, use the total seconds for the 365.24 days as mentioned in this report.
