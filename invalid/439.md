# Initial user of LMPVault can abuse rounding error to steal tokens
## Summary

Similar to the well known attack vector - [TOB-YEARN](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/blob/master/audits/20210719_ToB_yearn_vaultsv2/ToB_-_Yearn_Vault_v_2_Smart_Contracts_Audit_Report.pdf).
ERC4626 vault contracts suffer from a commonly known vulnerability due to division rounding. The initial user can
massively skew the ratio of shares to assets with a large"donation", and can profit off of later users.

## Vulnerability Detail

In LMPVault, the deposit function has no minimum deposit limit or burn. It calls `previewDeposit()` with `_convertToShares(assets, Math.Rounding.Down)` to calculate the number of shares. This function `_convertToShares()` takes into account the totalAssets() returning the sum of `totalIdle` and `totalDebt`.

However, due to rounding errors, an attacker who deposits to a fresh vault can skew the ratio by transferring in a large quantity of TOKE tokens by following these steps.
1. Attacker deposits 1 wei of TOKE token, minting 1 wei of shares
2. Attacker then sends a large amount (1e18 wei) of TOKE tokens to the vault.
3. Normal user comes and deposits 2e18 wei of TOKE tokens. Shares calculated = 2e18 * 1 / (1e18+1) = 1 wei
4. User only gets minted 1 wei of token, giving him/her claim to only half the vault, which has 3e18 wei tokens, instantly losing their  0.5e18 tokens which is profited by the attacker.


## Impact
Exploit by first user of vault. Loss of tokens by other users

## Tool used

Manual Review + in-house tool

## Recommendation
Burn the first (if totalSupply() == 0) 10000wei of minted shares by sending them to address 0. This will make the cost to pull of this attack unfeasible.
