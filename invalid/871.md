# Wrong update of Idle for rebasing tokens like stETH
## Summary
Wrong update of Idle for rebasing tokens like stETH

## Vulnerability Detail

On the `mint` function in the `LMPVault` contract it transfers the assets from the caller via `_transferAndMint` and then it adds those assets to the idle:

```solidity
 _baseAsset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

 totalIdle += assets;
```
As tokemak supports tokens like stETH, this is a problem because `totalIdle` will mostly be wrong in lot of the cases due to its rebalance mechanisms. 

stETH updates its supply everyday, which means that once the supply is updated (at 12PM UTC), the `totalIdle` will be wrong, and in fact, there will be more or less tokens in the idle. 

Directly adding the assets sent to the vault to the idle will still have an incorrect `totalIdle ` because it was not updated first

You can check the mechanism of stETH in the [docs](https://blog.lido.fi/steth-the-mechanics-of-steth/)

## Impact
Incorrect idle will be kept in the contract, affecting all the transactions fetching the `totalIdle` variable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the balance of the token, like stETH before, to have a correct idle value, and then add the sent assets to the updated idle
