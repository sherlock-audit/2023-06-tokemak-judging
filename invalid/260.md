# Not using Percentage to calculate  rewardRate would give room for precision errors when dealing with tokens small decimal number
## Summary
Not using Percentage to calculate  rewardRate would give room for precision errors when dealing with small tokens at L285 of the AbstractRewarder.sol contract
## Vulnerability Detail
not using percentage to calculate  rewardRate in [L285](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L285) of the AbstractRewarder.sol contract will give room for rewardRate precision error which could escalate to zero rewards and eventual lose of fund.
```solidity
285.   rewardRate = reward / durationInBlock;
```
 A quick scenario example 
1. reward  value is  9 * 10 ** 6 (low decimal token)
2. durationInBlock value is 9000001
3. rewardRate = 9 * 10 ** 6 / 9000001
4. rewardRate will return zero
## Impact
This vulnerability will give room for rewardRate precision error which could escalate to zero rewards and eventual lose of fund. The chances having a low decimal token could be marked low but the impact when it is indeed used would be high which makes this submission a medium severity

```solidity
285.   rewardRate = reward / durationInBlock;
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
using a percentage value e.g 10000 would help to prevent this, 
```solidity
         +++   rewardRate = (reward*10000) / durationInBlock;
285.  ---   rewardRate = reward / durationInBlock;
```
the most important thing is to ensure the percentage value is used as denominator after multiplication in all situations were rewardRate is used e.g in L281
```solidity
         +++   uint256 leftover = (remaining * rewardRate)/10000;
281.  ---   uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
```
