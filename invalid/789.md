# Maliciuos user can claim Reward, when protocol is paused despite access control.
## Summary
The Tokemark protocol's flaw permits users to claim rewards despite being in a paused state. While the `claimRewards()` function is properly guarded, the corresponding `getReward()` function lacks such protection, undermining the emergency stop mechanism.
## Vulnerability Detail

Tokemark Implements an emergency stop mechanism that can be triggered by an account that has been granted the `EMERGENCY_PAUSER` role. This is to be done under extreme conditions (say during some severe exploit). The way this is implemented is that there is [`pausable.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/security/Pausable.sol) which is inherited by [`LMPVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L44) contract which in turn implements modifiers `whenPaused()` and `whenNotPaused()`.

One of the restrictions is on [`claimReward()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L540) function of the `LMPVault.sol` when the protocol is in paused state.

Normally users will claim Reward by calling the `claimRewards()` on the LMPVault.sol contract, which in turn calls the [`getReward()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L95) function of the corresponding rewarder contract wherein the actual rewards are being transferred to users.

However, there is `whenNotPaused()` modifier on `claimRewards()` of LMPVault.sol contract restricting the access when the protocol is paused, as it should.

```solidity
    function claimRewards() public whenNotPaused {
        rewarder.getReward(msg.sender, true);
    }
```

But the problem here is that any user can call the `getReward()` function of the corresponding rewarder contract directly and claim the rewards as there is no restriction there, even when the protocol is under paused state.

[MainRewarder.sol#L95-L106](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L95-L106)

```solidity
    function getReward() external nonReentrant {
        _updateReward(msg.sender);
        _processRewards(msg.sender, true);
    }


    function getReward(address account, bool claimExtras) external nonReentrant {
        if (msg.sender != address(stakeTracker) && msg.sender != account) {
            revert Errors.AccessDenied();
        }
        _updateReward(account);
        _processRewards(account, claimExtras);
    }
```



## Impact

Anyone can claim rewards despite the protocol being paused.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement access control on `getReward()` which checks for LMPVaults state (paused or unpaused) before proceeding.
