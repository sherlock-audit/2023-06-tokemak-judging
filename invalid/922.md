# LMPVault.sol::recover() - Lack of input validations
## Summary
QA/Low/Medium?

1. M: LMPVault.sol::recover() - no check to see if arrays contain default values only >>> damage potential probably low >>> transfer of zero token amounts.

2. M: LMPVault.sol::recover() - no check for duplicate array entries >>> unless it's part of intended protocol functionality?

3. M: LMPVault.sol::recover() - it's clear that one or more of the 3 dynamic arrays, could have only default values while having array length > 0. It seems negative impact is low.
