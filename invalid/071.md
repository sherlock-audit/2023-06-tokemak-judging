# LMPDestinations.setWithdrawalQueue() will clear all destination addresses queued {including the new ones} whenever new list is smaller than old list(previous list)
## Summary

LMPDestinations.setWithdrawalQueue() will clear all destination addresses queued {including the new ones} whenever new list  is smaller than old list(previous list)

## Vulnerability Detail

This issue is caused by these [LoC](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDestinations.sol#L63-L66)

The `setWithdrawalQueue()`  function overwrites the old list(`withdrawalQueue.length`) with the new destination addresses to be queued ( `_destinations.length`) as long as new list is < old list(*i.e already existing list of destination addresses in the `withdrawalQueue` array*)
You'll see that [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDestinations.sol#L49-L54)

Now since the old list is overwritten with new list whenever the new list is < than old list, attempting to pop (*i.e delete*) old list from the `withdrawalQueue` will also delete the new list that was used to overwrite the old list.

**Here is a more vivid scenario:**
new list (`_destinations.length`) has 5 destination addresses on it.

old list (`withdrawalQueue.length`) has 10 queued destination addresses already queued on it.

Now the new 5 destination addresses will overwrite 5 already existing destination addresses in `withdrawalQueue`, which will be addresses on slot 0-4 in the `withdrawalQueue`.

now since the old list is > than new list, all queued destination addresses in `withdrawalQueue` will be cleared including the new ones used to overwrite the old ones [HERE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDestinations.sol#L63-L66)

## Impact

LMPDestinations.setWithdrawalQueue() will clear all destination addresses queued {including the new ones} whenever new list is smaller than old list(*previous list*)

## Recommendation

do this  instead:: pop only the difference btw old and new list

```solidity
+    uint256 j;
       if (oldLength > newLength) {

-          for (; i < oldLength; ++i) {//@audit-issue this will clear everything, because i = 0

+            for (j = newLength; j < oldLength; ++j) { // j is newLength

             // @audit-info pop only the difference btw old and new length

                withdrawalQueue.pop();
            }
        }

```

i hope this helps.
