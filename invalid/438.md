# Calculation in the _claimRewards function is susceptible to exploits
## Summary
The claimRewards function as written is vulnerable to exploits if there are other external transfers of the reward tokens occurring at the same time. The key issue is that it calculates the amount claimed by taking the difference in the token balance before and after calling the getReward function. This difference could include tokens transferred from other sources, not just the rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
The key issue is that the amount claimed is calculated by taking the difference in the recipient's balance before and after calling the claimRewards() function [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/rewards/MaverickRewardsAdapter.sol#L63-L71). This assumes that the change in balance is entirely due to the rewards being claimed. However, if there are any other external transfers of the reward token to/from the recipient happening at the same time, it will affect the balance and cause the claimed amount to be incorrect.
How it is exploited:
1. Attacker calls claimRewards(), noting the balanceBefore
2. In a separate transaction, attacker transfers 10 tokens to the recipient
3. claimRewards() finishes, balanceAfter is now 10 tokens higher due to the separate transfer
4. amountsClaimed is balanceAfter - balanceBefore = 10 tokens too high
So the attacker got an extra 10 rewards tokens. 

In essence - The problem is that amountClaimed is calculating the difference in the sendTo balance before and after claiming the reward. However, if there are any external transfers of the reward token to/from sendTo during this process, those transfers will incorrectly be counted as part of the claimed amount. For example, say the balanceBefore is 100 tokens. The actual reward claimed is 50 tokens. But before balanceAfter is checked, someone else sends sendTo 25 more tokens. Now balanceAfter will be 175 tokens, so amountClaimed is calculated as 175 - 100 = 75 tokens, even though only 50 were actually claimed.


## Impact
This allows an attacker to falsely inflate the claimed reward amounts and steal extra tokens. The impact would depend on the value of the reward tokens

## Recommendation
Instead of relying on balance changes, the claimed amounts should be based on the actual return value from the reward contract's getReward() function
