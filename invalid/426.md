# starting minPrice at type(uint256).max can lead to overflow vulnerabilities
## Summary
starting minPrice at type(uint256).max opens up the possibility of an overflow vulnerability.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is that if a token price overflows and ends up as a very small number below minPrice, it will incorrectly become the new minPrice. For example, say minPrice starts at 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935. If a token price overflows and ends up as 1, it will become the new minPrice.
## Impact
the final LP token price calculated can be manipulated based on minPrice.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 minPrice should be initialized to 0 instead of type(uint256).max.
