# Flawed Sequence: Assets Transferred Before Minting Shares
## Summary
The `_transferAndMint` function in the provided code has a potential issue regarding the order of operations when transferring assets and minting shares. The current order of asset transfer followed by share minting might lead to unintended consequences where all assets are transferred, leaving no assets available for minting shares.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_transferAndMint` function, the assets are first transferred from the sender's address to the contract, and then new shares are minted to the specified receiver. The function is designed this way to address potential reentrancy concerns with ERC777 tokens, as indicated by the comments in the code.

However, due to the order of operations, there's a risk that all assets are transferred to the contract before any shares are minted. This could potentially leave the contract's balance empty and prevent the minting of shares, leading to unintended behavior.

Here's the current problematic code snippet:
```solidity
_baseAsset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

totalIdle += assets;

_mint(receiver, shares);

emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
```
## Impact
All assets could be transferred without any corresponding shares being minted. This can lead to situations where the minting of shares is not possible due to the lack of available assets, causing discrepancies between the intended behavior and the actual outcome of the function.
## Code Snippet
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L604-L621)
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The order of operations should be adjusted as follows:
1. Mint the new shares to the specified receiver.
2. Transfer the assets from the sender's address to the contract.
3. Update the totalIdle counter after the asset transfer.
Here's the corrected code snippet:
```solidity
// Mint the shares first
_mint(receiver, shares);

// Perform the asset transfer after minting shares
_baseAsset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

// Update totalIdle after the transfer
totalIdle += assets;

emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
```
By minting the shares before transferring the assets, the contract ensures that sufficient assets are available for minting shares, preventing the possibility of transferring all assets without minting any shares. This adjusted order of operations mitigates the potential issue and aligns with the intended behavior of the function.
