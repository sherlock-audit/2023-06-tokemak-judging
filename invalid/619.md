# The currentRatio variable being mutable makes the contract vulnerable to manipulation
## Summary
The issue is that currentRatio is a storage variable that can be directly updated. A malicious contract could call the update() function to emit a RatioUpdated event with arbitrary data, without actually updating the true ratio.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is that currentRatio is a storage variable that can be directly updated. A malicious contract could call the update() function to emit a RatioUpdated event with arbitrary data, without actually updating the true ratio.
This could trick integrators into thinking the ratio is something it's not. Dapps relying on the ratio for pricing or to make protocol decisions could be exploited.
To exploit:
1. A lending protocol integrates with this contract to determine collateralization ratios. It relies on the RatioUpdated events to know the current ratio.
2. The attacker updates the ratio legitimately via update(), emitting a RatioUpdated event.
3. The attacker directly manipulates currentRatio to a lower value without emitting an event.
4. Now the lending protocol still thinks the old, higher ratio is current. It believes loans are well collateralized when they are actually undercollateralized based on the real (lower) ratio.
5. The lending protocol allows borrows against the collateral, believing the ratio is higher than it truly is.
6. If asset prices drop, the lowered real ratio could cause loans to become dangerously undercollateralized. This could allow borrowers to default and cause loss of funds for the protocol.


## Impact
The lowered real ratio will cause loans to become dangerously undercollateralized. This can allow borrowers to default and cause loss of funds for the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation 

- Make currentRatio immutable
- Instead of directly updating currentRatio, update a separate storage 
- Add an onlyOwner modifier to update() so only the contract owner can update it
