# Vault is meant to be upgradable but does not inherit OZ's upgradable contract
## Summary
Lack of compatability in inherited contract of LMPVault and DestinationVault as it is meant to be upgradable.

## Vulnerability Detail
For instance, LMPVault inherits ERC20Permit which is the non upgradable version. Openzeppelin implements an upgradable version for use with upgradable contracts that guarantees safety usage. Openzeppelin has their version of upgradable contract, [ERC20PermitUpgradable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20PermitUpgradeable.sol).

Likewise, DestinationVault inherits ERC20 instead of ERC20Upgradable.

## Impact
Vault is meant to be upgradable but is not inheritting from the correct upgradable contracts.
