# `maxMint()` allows minting of infinite shares when `!_isVaultCollateralized()`
## Summary

[**`LMPVault`**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol) **`totalSupplyLimit`** and **`perWalletLimit`** checks will be bypassed when the vault is not collateralized.

## Vulnerability Detail

***These variables are used as upper bounds in the `LMPVault`***

- **`totalSupplyLimit`** The max total supply of shares we'll allow to be minted
- **`perWalletLimit`** The max shares a single wallet is allowed to hold

The protocol intention was to return the min between **`totalSupplyLimit`** and **`perWalletLimit`** when **`totalSupply() == 0`**, but they misused **`_isVaultCollateralized`** instead:

```solidity
    function _isVaultCollateralized() internal view returns (bool) {
        return totalAssets() > 0 || totalSupply() == 0;
    }
```

And here is the **`maxMint()`** function implementation:

```solidity
    function _maxMint(address wallet) internal view virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
        // If we are temporarily paused, or in full shutdown mode,
        // no new shares are able to be minted
        if (paused() || _shutdown) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 tsLimit = totalSupplyLimit;
        uint256 walletLimit = perWalletLimit;

        if (!_isVaultCollateralized()) {
            return Math.min(tsLimit, walletLimit);
        }

        // Return max if there is no limit as per spec
        if (tsLimit == type(uint256).max && walletLimit == type(uint256).max) {
            return type(uint256).max;
        }

        // Ensure we aren't over the total supply limit
        uint256 totalSupply = totalSupply();
        if (totalSupply >= tsLimit) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Ensure the wallet isn't over the per wallet limit
        uint256 walletBalance = balanceOf(wallet);

        if (walletBalance >= perWalletLimit) {
            return 0;
        }

        // User gets the minimum of of the limit buffers
        shares = Math.min(tsLimit - totalSupply, walletLimit - walletBalance);
    }
```

You can see that the function preform some sanity checks to ensure that the amount being minted is under certain bounds, but the issue is that the **`_isVaultCollateralized()`** was misused which will result in more shares being minted than the protocol desire.

- The **`maxMint()`** function first checks if the vault is sufficiently collateralized. If it's not, it returns the min value between the total supply limit and the per-wallet limit.

- The function checks whether the current total supply of shares has reached or exceeded the specified **`totalSupplyLimit`**. If this condition is met, it means that no more shares can be minted without violating the overall supply limit. In this case, the function returns 0.

- Similarly, the function checks whether the balance of shares owned by the specific wallet has reached or exceeded the **`perWalletLimit`**. If this condition is met, it means that the wallet's share balance cannot increase further without exceeding its individual limit. In this case, the function returns 0.

Thus, when the vault is not collateralized, it bypass both **`totalSupplyLimit`** and **`perWalletLimit`** checks and return the minimum value between the supply limit and the wallet limit.

**Note (This was confirmed by the sponsor):** *No that was not the intention. This was more meant to capture the scenario that there are no deposits in the vault.*


## Impact

**`totalSupplyLimit`** and **`perWalletLimit`** will be bypassed when the vault is not collateralized, hence unlimited shares can be minted.

Manual review

## Recommendation

We recommend updating the misused check as follow: 

```solidity
        if (totalSupply() == 0) {
            return Math.min(tsLimit, walletLimit);
        }
```
