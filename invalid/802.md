# MaverickAdapter.removeLiquidity() can become stuck
## Summary

removeLiquidity() function (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/MaverickAdapter.sol #L131-L178) can be run multiple times for the same tokens. If these tokens are ERC20 which does not allow positive amount assertion (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src /destinations/adapters/MaverickAdapter.sol#L145) when the tolerance is already positive, the function may hang.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#approval-race-protections

The MaverickAdapter.removeLiquidity() function can be called multiple times by the user to remove the assets piecemeal. After the first call for the tokens described above, the second withdrawal will be blocked.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a zero-sum assertion before the actual sum assertion, i.e. force a zero valid value before the current assertion.
