# Tokens with `decimals` larger than `18` are not supported
## Summary
For tokens with decimals larger than 18, the codebase will revert due to underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail
`getPriceInEth` retrieves price information from a liquidity pool. However, this function would always revert if token or baseToken have more than 18 decimals.
