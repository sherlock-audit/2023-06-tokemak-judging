# Possible unintentional token transfer due to Underflow Risk in Calculating Claimed Rewards from `_claimRewards` function
## Summary
 The `_claimRewards` function in the provided code is at risk of encountering underflow when subtracting `balancesBefore[i]` from the `balance` of claimed rewards. This could lead to negative values and unintended behavior during reward distribution.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_claimRewards` function is responsible for claiming rewards for Convex staked LP tokens. It calculates the claimed reward amounts by subtracting `balancesBefore[i]` from the current `balance`. However, if the `balance` after claiming rewards is less (of which is logicaly positively true) than `balancesBefore[i]`, the subtraction will result in an underflow, potentially leading to negative `amountsClaimed[i]` and incorrect token transfers.

Here's the relevant code snippet from the _claimRewards function:
```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalLength; ++i) {
            uint256 balance = 0;
            // Same check for "stash tokens"
            if (IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).totalSupply() > 0) {
                balance = IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).balanceOf(account);
            }

            amountsClaimed[i] = balance - balancesBefore[i];

            if (sendTo != address(this) && amountsClaimed[i] > 0) {
                IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(sendTo, amountsClaimed[i]);
            }
        }
```
## Impact
The underflow vulnerability can result in negative `amountsClaimed[i]`, leading to incorrect token transfers. If the `balance` after claiming rewards is less than `balancesBefore[i]`, the subtraction operation will lead to unintended behavior. This can result in tokens being transferred unintentionally and could cause financial losses for both the smart contract and users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the underflow risk, it's vital to ensure that `balance` (representing the reward token balance after rewards have been claimed) is less than or equal to( meaning rewards were never claimed ) `balancesBefore[i]` (the reward token balance before rewards have been claimed) before performing the subtraction operation. Here's the accurate mitigation step:
```solidity
// ... (omitted for brevity) ...

// get balances after and calculate amounts claimed
for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalLength; ++i) {
    uint256 balance = 0;
    // Same check for "stash tokens"
    if (IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).totalSupply() > 0) {
        balance = IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)); // Check contract's token balance
    }

    if (balance >= balancesBefore[i]) {
        amountsClaimed[i] = balance - balancesBefore[i];

        if (sendTo != address(this) && amountsClaimed[i] > 0) {
            IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(sendTo, amountsClaimed[i]);
        }
    } else {
        amountsClaimed[i] = 0;  // Set to zero to prevent negative amounts
    }
}

// ... (omitted for brevity) ...
