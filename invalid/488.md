# LMPVault.maxDeposit has incorrect scaling of the maxAssets value
## Summary

`LMPVault.maxDeposit` has incorrect scaling of the `maxAssets` value, leading to a potential erroneous revert and inconsistency among functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LMPVault.maxDeposit` calculates the amount of assets that a user can deposit to mint the maximum number of shares.  Since the returned values of `previewDeposit` and `previewMint`  are used inside `deposit` and `mint` functions respectively as the values of shares minted/assets transferred. Those returned values should be the authoritative sources for determining the conversion between assets and shares, or vice versa. 
This means that the correct maximum assets value  obtained from `maxDeposit(wallet)` should be equal to `previewMint(maxMint(wallet))`.  To satisfy that, the calculation for `maxAssets` within `LMPVault.maxDeposit` should be scaled up. However, the calculation for `maxAssets` is currently scaled down, leading to an inaccurate maximum deposit value. Consequently, when users attempt to deposit the true maximum assets value using the `deposit` function, it can result in a revert due to the current `maxDeposit(wallet)` being lower than the actual maximum deposit value.


## Impact

This vulnerability causes a potential erroneous revert and introduces the mismatch among the `deposit`, `maxDeposit` functions and  `mint`, `previewDeposit`, `previewMint` functions. The `mint` function works as expected to mint the maximum numbers of shares, while the `deposit` function might revert when attempting to achieve an equivalent state (with matching values of shares minted and assets transferred). This inconsistency can disrupt users' ability to make accurate deposits.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `maxDeposit` function should be updated to scale up the `maxAssets` value using the `_convertToAssets` function with rounding set to `Math.Rounding.Up`. Here is the recommended change:

```solidity
function maxDeposit(
    address wallet
) public view virtual override returns (uint256 maxAssets) {
    maxAssets = _convertToAssets(_maxMint(wallet), Math.Rounding.Up);
    // Corrected: The scaling of maxAssets is using Math.Rounding.Up
    // to accurately calculate the maxDeposit value for users.
}
```
