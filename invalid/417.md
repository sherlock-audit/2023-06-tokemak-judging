# More than expected ````GPToke```` tokens would be minted to users
## Summary
The ````endYearpoc```` of ````previewPoints()```` is not calculated correctly, it would cause more than expected ````GPToke ```` tokens to be minted.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises on L192 of ````previewPoints()```` function, the ````startEpoch```` variable is used to calculate ````endYearpoc````, but actually  ````start```` should be used. As in most cases, ````start > startEpoch````, this would cause ````multiplier````(L193) and ````points````(L195) are much bigger than it should be.
```diff
File: src\staking\GPToke.sol
183:     function previewPoints(uint256 amount, uint256 duration) public view returns (uint256 points, uint256 end) {
184:         if (duration < minStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooShort();
185:         if (duration > maxStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooLong();
186: 
187:         // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
188:         uint256 start = block.timestamp > startEpoch ? block.timestamp : startEpoch;
189:         end = start + duration;
190: 
191:         // calculate points based on duration from staking end date
-192:        uint256 endYearpoc = ((end - startEpoch) * 1e18) / 365 days;
+            uint256 endYearpoc = ((end - start) * 1e18) / 365 days;
193:         uint256 multiplier = PRBMathUD60x18.pow(YEAR_BASE_BOOST, endYearpoc);
194: 
195:         points = (amount * multiplier) / 1e18;
196:     }


File: src\staking\GPToke.sol
098:     function _stake(uint256 amount, uint256 duration, address to) internal whenNotPaused {
... 
106:         // duration checked inside previewPoints
107:         (uint256 points, uint256 end) = previewPoints(amount, duration);
...
119:         // create points for user
120:         _mint(to, points);
...
126:     }

```



## Impact
````previewPoints()```` is called by ````_stake()````, users can repeatly stake with ````minStakeDuration```` to mint lots of ````GPToke```` token, which would completely break the contract.
