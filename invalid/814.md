# Lack of deadline check in the Univ3Swap contract
## Summary

There is a lack of deadline check in the UniV3Swap contract. In the event of a huge inflow of transactions, the swap can be stuck in the mempool for a long time, resulting in an unfavourable trade

## Vulnerability Detail

deadline variable in UniswapV3 is set to block.timestamp, which means that there is no deadline for Uniswap swaps.

```solidity
    function swap(
        address routerAddress,
        address sellTokenAddress,
        uint256 sellAmount,
        address,
        uint256 minBuyAmount,
        bytes memory data
    ) external override onlyRouter returns (uint256) {
        IERC20(sellTokenAddress).safeApprove(routerAddress, sellAmount);


        IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
            path: data,
            recipient: address(this),
 ->           deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: minBuyAmount
        });
```

## Impact

Swap transactions may be stale, which may result in unfavourable trades

## Recommendation

Recommend adding a input parameter for timestamp or setting a proper deadline for the swap.
