# Malicious user can call getReward to grief user rewards
## Summary
Malicious user can call getReward to grief user rewards

## Vulnerability Detail

In LMPVault.sol
```solidity
function _updateDebtReporting(address[] memory _destinations) private {
        uint256 nDest = _destinations.length;

        uint256 idleIncrease = 0;
        uint256 prevNTotalDebt = 0;
        uint256 afterNTotalDebt = 0;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < nDest; ++i) {
            IDestinationVault destVault = IDestinationVault(_destinations[i]);

            if (!destinations.contains(address(destVault))) {
                revert InvalidDestination(address(destVault));
            }

            // Get the reward value we've earned. DV rewards are always in terms of base asset
            // We track the gas used purely for off-chain stats purposes
            // Main rewarder on DV's store the earned and liquidated rewards
            // Extra rewarders are disabled at the DV level
            uint256 claimGasUsed = gasleft();
            uint256 beforeBaseAsset = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
            // We don't want any extras, those would likely not be baseAsset
			
            IMainRewarder(destVault.rewarder()).getReward(address(this), false);
            uint256 claimedRewardValue = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - beforeBaseAsset;
```

in the function `_updateDebtReporting` near the end of the logic above we see the following snippet of logic
```solidity
 uint256 beforeBaseAsset = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
            // We don't want any extras, those would likely not be baseAsset
			
            IMainRewarder(destVault.rewarder()).getReward(address(this), false);
            uint256 claimedRewardValue = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - beforeBaseAsset;
```

first the beforeBaseAssett is asigned the value of the current balanceOf. Then the function calls `getReward` which will claim rewards and add them to the users balance.

finally the `claimedRewardValue` is asigned to the difference of the new `balanceOf` and `beforeBaseAsset`. This flow of account is problematic because a malicious user can front-run 

`_updateDebtReporting` with `getReward`. This will cause `claimedRewardValue` to be 0 because rewards were claimed right before this tx. The users rewards are lost and stuck in the contract, unable to be retrieved by the user. 

## POC

1. Malicious user see `_updateDebtReporting` in the mempool
2. malicious user then front runs this with `getReward`
3. when `_updateDebtReporting` goes through it will also call `getReward`, but the value will be 0 because the malicious user has just called the function to claim the reward for the contract
4. `claimedRewardValue` will be 0 and the users tokens will be stuck in the contract.

## Impact
Malicious user can easily grief a users rewards and have them be stuck in the contract with no to recover them.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
i recommend to implement logic that is not able to be frontrun to grief a users rewards.
