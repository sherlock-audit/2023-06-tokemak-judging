# Rewards earned charged a fee twice
## Summary

Rewards earned from external protocols (e.g., Convex or Aura) are charged a fee twice by the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

For simplicity's sake, assume that there is only one (1) LMPVault and one (1) DV within the protocol. Assume that $x$ CVX reward tokens are claimed from Convex's rewarder by the `LiquidationRow` contract.

When liquidating reward tokens, $x$ CVX will be swapped to $y$ WETH (base assets) at line 251 below. A portion of $y$ WETH will be taken away as the fee at Line 255. Let the fee charged be $fee_{liquidation}$. Thus, the remaining portion of the $y$ WETH left after the fee is $y - fee_{liquidation}$ WETH. 

Subsequently, $y - fee_{liquidation}$ WETH is queued to the Destination Vault's main rewarder contract pending LMPVault to collect them.

```solidity
File: LiquidationRow.sol
240:     function _performLiquidation(
..SNIP..
249:         uint256 length = vaultsToLiquidate.length;
250:         // the swapper checks that the amount received is greater or equal than the params.buyAmount
251:         uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);
252: 
253:         // if the fee feature is turned on, send the fee to the fee receiver
254:         if (feeReceiver != address(0) && feeBps > 0) {
255:             uint256 fee = calculateFee(amountReceived);
..SNIP..
258:             // adjust the amount received after deducting the fee
259:             amountReceived -= fee;
260:             // transfer fee to the fee receiver
261:             IERC20(params.buyTokenAddress).safeTransfer(feeReceiver, fee);
262:         }
```

When LMPVault collects the WETH rewards from the DV's main rewarder, the vault's `totalIdle` will be increased by $y - fee_{liquidation}$ WETH. 

The `idle` represents the latest total idle assets in the vault, and it is passed into the `_collectFees` function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L752

```solidity
File: LMPVault.sol
752:     function _updateDebtReporting(address[] memory _destinations) private {
..SNIP..
773:             IMainRewarder(destVault.rewarder()).getReward(address(this), false);
..SNIP..
790:         // Persist our change in idle and debt
791:         uint256 idle = totalIdle + idleIncrease;
792:         uint256 debt = totalDebt - prevNTotalDebt + afterNTotalDebt;
793: 
794:         totalIdle = idle;
795:         totalDebt = debt;
796: 
797:         _collectFees(idle, debt, totalSupply());
798:     }
```

Within the `_collectFees` function, the `profit` at Line 818 will be the profit earned by the LMPVault after collecting the reward tokens, equal to  $y - fee_{liquidation}$ WETH. At Line 819, a performance fee is charged against the $y - fee_{liquidation}$ WETH profit. The fees are charged as a dilution of the user's share value.

File: LMPVault.sol
800:     function _collectFees(uint256 idle, uint256 debt, uint256 totalSupply) internal {
..SNIP..
812:         uint256 currentNavPerShare = ((idle + debt) * MAX_FEE_BPS) / totalSupply;
813:         uint256 effectiveNavPerShareHighMark = navPerShareHighMark;
814: 
815:         if (currentNavPerShare > effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) {
816:             // Even if we aren't going to take the fee (haven't set a sink)
817:             // We still want to calculate so we can emit for off-chain analysis
818:             profit = (currentNavPerShare - effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) * totalSupply;
819:             fees = profit.mulDiv(performanceFeeBps, (MAX_FEE_BPS ** 2), Math.Rounding.Up);
820:             if (fees > 0 && sink != address(0)) {
821:                 // Calculated separate from other mints as normal share mint is round down
822:                 shares = _convertToShares(fees, Math.Rounding.Up);
823:                 _mint(sink, shares);
824:                 emit Deposit(address(this), sink, fees, shares);
825:             }
```

## Impact

Loss of profit for the vault shareholders as the reward earned is charged a fee twice. To aggravate the issue, both of each charge a fee proportionate to the reward earned.

A fee is charged every time to move from one contract to another (LiquidatorRow > Destination Vault's Rewarder AND Destination Vault's Rewarder > LMPVault).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider charging a fee only on the LMPVault side instead of both sides. In addition, consider funding the cost of liquidating reward tokens by taking a portion of the protocol fee collected with the approval of the DAO/community.
