# Potential DoS Risk due to Gas Exhaustion in `registerPool` Function
## Summary
The `registerPool` function within the contract exhibits a potential risk of a Denial of Service (DoS) occurrence resulting from gas exhaustion. The vulnerability arises due to a loop that processes an array and could lead to excessive gas consumption, potentially surpassing the gas limit of a block.
## Vulnerability Detail
The primary function of `registerPool` is to enable the registration of a Curve LP token with the oracle. While this process involves crucial validations, the vulnerability becomes apparent in the following loop section:
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < numTokens;) {
    lpTokenToUnderlying[lpToken].push(tokens[i]);

    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```
This loop is designed to populate the `lpTokenToUnderlying` mapping with token addresses. However, in scenarios where the tokens array is excessively large, the loop's gas consumption could surpass the gas limit of a block. This situation creates an opportunity for malicious actors to exploit the vulnerability and deliberately consume an excessive amount of gas, potentially causing a DoS condition.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that a malicious attacker could exploit the gas exhaustion risk within the `registerPool` function, targeting the contract owner. By flooding the function with an array of tokens of substantial size, the attacker could trigger excessive gas consumption, potentially surpassing the block's gas limit. This could result in the contract owner being forced to expend an unbounded amount of gas to execute the function and successfully complete the token registration. This situation not only consumes significant resources but also potentially disrupts the owner's ability to effectively manage the contract, creating a scenario similar to a Denial of Service attack.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I suggest to limit the max number of loop iterations to prevent hitting block gas limit.
