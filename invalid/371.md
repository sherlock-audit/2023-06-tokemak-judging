# #FrxBeaconChainBacking.update() is missing sanity checks
## Summary

Missing sanity checks in [**`#FrxBeaconChainBacking.update()`**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/beacon/FrxBeaconChainBacking.sol#L38) may lead to incorrect calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail

***Note: This is not a centralized risk.***

The **`update()`** function serves the purpose of updating and maintaining the information about the staking ratio on the Beacon Chain, and it is responsible for maintaining an accurate and up-to-date record of the staking ratio of the token on the Beacon Chain. The issue lies in the lack of proper input validation within the function.

### ***Simple coded Scenarios to Illustrate the Issue***

#### Zero timestamp case:

```solidity
    function testUpdateWithZeroTimestamp() public {
        uint208 totalAssets = 90;
        uint208 totalLiabilities = 10;
        uint48 queriedTimestamp = 0;

        uint256 expectedRatio = 9_000_000_000_000_000_000;

        beaconBacking.update(totalAssets, totalLiabilities, queriedTimestamp);

        (uint208 ratio, uint48 timestamp) = beaconBacking.current();

        assertEq(ratio, expectedRatio);
        assertEq(timestamp, 0);
    }
```

*Result:*

```solidity
Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; finished in 10.34s
```

This scenario showcases that the function does not adequately prevent updates with invalid timestamps in the first time. Leading to inaccurate calculations and decisions based on the protocol's historical staking data.

#### The same Timestamp case: 

```solidity
    function testUpdateWithTheSameTimestamp() public {
        uint208 totalAssets = 90;
        uint208 totalLiabilities = 10;
        uint48 queriedTimestamp = 999;

        uint256 expectedRatio = 9_000_000_000_000_000_000;

        beaconBacking.update(totalAssets, totalLiabilities, queriedTimestamp);

        (uint208 ratio, uint48 timestamp) = beaconBacking.current();

        assertEq(ratio, expectedRatio);
        assertEq(timestamp, 999);

        totalAssets = 80;
        totalLiabilities = 10;
        queriedTimestamp = 999;

        expectedRatio = 8_000_000_000_000_000_000;

        beaconBacking.update(totalAssets, totalLiabilities, queriedTimestamp);

        (uint208 ratio2, uint48 timestamp2) = beaconBacking.current();

        assertEq(ratio2, expectedRatio);
        assertEq(timestamp2, 999);
    }
```

*Result:*

```solidity
Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; finished in 9.51s
```

In this test case, the impact of the issue becomes evident when the function **`FrxBeaconChainBacking.update()`** is allowed to update the ratio with the same timestamp multiple times. Without proper validation, this situation results in the ability to overwrite existing ratio records with the same timestamp, such inaccuracies could lead to suboptimal decision-making within the protocol's operations.

## Impact

**`FrxBeaconChainBacking.update()`** function could lead to inaccurate records of the staking ratio, which is a crucial piece of data for the protocol. Specifically, possiblility to update the ratio with timestamps that are not in chronological order. This could lead to inconsistent and incorrect historical staking ratio records, potentially impacting the accuracy of calculations and decisions made based on this data.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend updating the function as follow: 

```solidity
    function update(
        uint208 totalAssets,
        uint208 totalLiabilities,
        uint48 queriedTimestamp
    ) public hasRole(Roles.LSD_BACKING_UPDATER) {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(totalAssets, "totalAssets");
        Errors.verifyNotZero(totalLiabilities, "totalLiabilities");
        Errors.verifyNotZero(queriedTimestamp, "queriedTimestamp");

        if (queriedTimestamp <= currentRatio.timestamp) {
            revert Errors.InvalidParam("queriedTimestamp");
        }
        uint208 ratio = totalAssets * decimalPad / totalLiabilities;
        currentRatio = Ratio(ratio, queriedTimestamp);

        emit RatioUpdated(ratio, totalAssets, totalLiabilities, queriedTimestamp);
    }

```
