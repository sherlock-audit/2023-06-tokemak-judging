# LMPVault may not be fully compatible with erc4626
## Summary

LMPVault may not be fully compatible with ERC-4626 if the **`_symbol`** or **`_desc`** values are set differently in the **`initialize()`** function compared to the **`constructor()`**.

## Vulnerability Detail

***EIP-4626 state that:***

> All EIP-4626 tokenized Vaults MUST implement EIP-20’s optional metadata extensions. The name and symbol functions SHOULD reflect the underlying token’s name and symbol in some way.

However, in LMPVault, both **`_symbol`** and **`_desc`** are set twice, once in the **`constructor()`**:

```solidity
        _symbol = ERC20(_vaultAsset).symbol();
        _desc = ERC20(_vaultAsset).name();
```

And then again in the **`initialize()`** function:

```solidity
        _symbol = symbolSuffix;
        _desc = descPrefix;
```

If the sender sets **`_symbol`** and **`_desc`** to different values than the underlying token's name and symbol, this will break compatibility with ERC-4626.

## Impact

LMPVault may not be fully compatible with ERC-4626, potentially causing some intergration problem in the future that can lead to wide range of issues for both parties.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend updating the initialize function to:

```solidity
    function initialize(
        uint256 supplyLimit,
        uint256 walletLimit,
        string memory symbolSuffix,
        string memory descPrefix,
        bytes memory
    ) public virtual initializer {
        Errors.verifyNotEmpty(symbolSuffix, "symbolSuffix");
        Errors.verifyNotEmpty(descPrefix, "descPrefix");

        // init withdrawal queue to empty (slither issue)
        withdrawalQueue = new IDestinationVault[](0);

        navPerShareHighMarkTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        _setTotalSupplyLimit(supplyLimit);
        _setPerWalletLimit(walletLimit);

        factory = msg.sender;
    }
```
