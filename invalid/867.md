After discussing with sponsors on why it's currently hardcoded as `0`, it was relayed to me that a _balanced pull_ is going to be implemented on this to get rid of the setting all together. However this is going to be an issue with Balancer's _Proportional Exit_ feature.

NB: On 22.08.2023 the Balancer team [announced](https://twitter.com/balancer/status/1694014645378724280?s=46&t=L_F_HqBkPbZIXiMvmVPQtQ) that a critical vulnerability has been relayed to them and as such advised that users withdraw their staked tokens and at the same time triggered the _proportional exit_ feature on multiple pools, which has been on up until the date of submitting this issue, i.e 29.08.2023, what this means is that this could placed on integrated pools for a long time and be an issue

## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at [BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol#L167-L194](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol#L167-L194)

```solidity
    function _burnUnderlyer(uint256 underlyerAmount)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        returns (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts)
    {
        uint256[] memory minAmounts = new uint256[](poolTokens.length);
        tokens = _convertToAddresses(poolTokens);
        amounts = isComposable
            ? BalancerBeethovenAdapter.removeLiquidityComposableImbalance(
                balancerVault,
                balancerPool,
                underlyerAmount,
                BalancerUtilities._convertERC20sToAddresses(poolTokens),
                minAmounts,
                //@audit
                0 // TODO: Make this configurable in initialization so we can target WETH and avoid a swap
            )
            : BalancerBeethovenAdapter.removeLiquidityImbalance(
                balancerVault,
                balancerPool,
                underlyerAmount,
                BalancerUtilities._convertERC20sToAddresses(poolTokens),
                minAmounts
            );
    }
```

The initial observation is the hardcoded value of `0` for the `exitTokenIndex`, so as to side step a swap to WETH, now the intention is to eventually replace this hardcoded value with a configuration setting for a balanced pull, but if _proportional exit_ feature has been triggered on a pool, the pull can no longer be balanced, since the way this feature works is that, say for example a ABC/XYZ pool is made up of 30% ABC and 70% ABC, a proportional exit will yield 0.3 ABC and 0.7 ABC for each BPT token, and not a 50/50 split.

The balanced pull configuration would cause inability of users to withdraw for as long as the _proportional exit_ feature is triggered on a pool, do note that even with this feature being triggered the Balancer team still **emphasized** on users withdrawing their tokens since if a black hat finds the vulnerability their assets could get stolen.

## Impact

- User's immediate loss of tokens if a black hat gets access

- Additionally user might want to do away with tokens and liquidate all his assets to USD cause he feels the market conditions are very bad, but he wouldn't be able to do this for days, _potentially weeks or as long as the feature lasts_, which would lead to a massive loss in USD value for user if prices drop (which is not uncommon in the crypto world).

## Tool used

Manual Audit

## Recommendation

Make withdrawal attempts more flexible and take into account that a pool could be in the _proportional exit_ state.
