# claimRewards  can be repeatedly called to claim rewards and transfer tokens even if no new rewards have been earned leading to DOS and gas wastage
## Summary
the claimRewards function can be called repeatedly, but it will keep executing the reward claiming logic even if there are no new rewards to claim. This can waste gas and DoS the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The key issue is that the claimRewards function can be called repeatedly, even though it will not actually claim additional rewards each time. Here is how an attacker could exploit this:
- The attacker calls claimRewards repeatedly in a loop.
- Each call will interact with the Maverick rewarder contract to check earned rewards and attempt to claim them.
- However, since balances are unchanged, no additional rewards will actually be claimed.
- This forces the contract to do useless work, consuming network resources and blocking legitimate users.
In addition - The key issue is that it calls getReward for each reward with a non-zero balance, without checking if rewards have already been claimed.

## Impact
1. Wasting network resources and gas fees, since the contract performs unnecessary operations.
2. Blocking legitimate users from calling the function, since the attacker's repeated calls saturate the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
Add a check that skips calling getReward if there are no unclaimed rewards.
