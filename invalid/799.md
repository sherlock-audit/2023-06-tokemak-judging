# Asset swap does not include slippage
## Summary

SwapRouter.swapForQuote passes the MaxSlippageExceeded check. This is provided for in the contract. However, it is not used correctly.

## Vulnerability Detail

uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(quoteToken).balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 balanceDiff = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
if (balanceDiff < minBuyAmount) revert MaxSlippageExceeded();

The swapForQuote() function is only called in DestinationVault.sol (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L273)

if (amounts[i] > 0) {
     IERC20(token).safeApprove(address(swapRouter), amounts[i]);
     amount += swapRouter.swapForQuote(token, amounts[i], _baseAsset, 0);
}

When called as a parameter, minBuyAmount (the minimum amount of the quote token expected to be received from the swap) is always 0 to the value.

So the check for MaxSlippageExceeded is always done. The intended slippage check is not performed. This may result in loss of funds.
