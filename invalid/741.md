# Multicall will not work with deposit() and mint() with ETH
## Summary
When doing deposit and mint transaction using multicall, it will revert as multicall uses delegateCall and preserves msg.value trough -out the transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
1 - Suppose Alice wants to deposit() and mint() with ETH using Multicall.
2 - She wants to deposit 1 ETH for x shares, and she wants 1e18 shares against x ETH.
3 - She creates a multicall transaction and submits.
4 - The transaction will fail as the deposit transaction will use msg.value and covert them to WETH, but for mint() transaction, the msg.value will fail as all the transaction in the ETH are used in deposit() transaction.

## Impact

Users will be unable to use Multicall for transactions that includes ETH. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) public payable override returns (bytes[] memory results) {
        results = new bytes[](data.length);

        /* solhint-disable avoid-low-level-calls, reason-string, no-inline-assembly */
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            // slither-disable-next-line delegatecall-loop,low-level-calls
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);

            if (!success) {
                // Next 5 lines from https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/83577
                if (result.length < 68) revert();
                // slither-disable-next-line assembly
                assembly {
                    result := add(result, 0x04)
                }
                revert(abi.decode(result, (string)));
            }

            results[i] = result;
        }
```
