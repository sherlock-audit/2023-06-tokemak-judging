# LMPVault deposits can be front-run and user funds stolen with ERC4626 inflation attack.
## Summary
Vault deposits can be front-run and user funds stolen with ERC4626 inflation attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
Attack scenario:
1. A hacker back-runs the transaction of LMPVault ERC4626 pool creation.
2. The hacker mints for themself one share: deposit(1). Thus, totalAsset()==1, totalSupply()==1.
3. The hacker front-runs the deposit of the victim who wants to deposit 20,000 tokens (20,000.000000).
4. The hacker inflates the denominator right in front of the victim: asset.transfer(20_000e6). Now totalAsset()==20_000e6 + 1, totalSupply()==1.
5. Next, the victim's tx takes place. The victim gets 1 * 20_000e6 / (20_000e6 + 1) == 0 shares. The victim gets zero shares.
The hacker burns their share and gets all the money.

        }

        // query number of shares these assets match
        shares = previewWithdraw(assets);

        uint256 actualAssets = _withdraw(assets, shares, receiver, owner);

## Impact
Vault deposits can be front-run and user funds stolen with inflation attack.

## Code Snippet
```solidity

        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        address owner

        Errors.verifyNotZero(assets, "assets");
        uint256 maxAssets = maxWithdraw(owner);
        if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(owner, assets, maxAssets);
        }

        // query number of shares these assets match
        shares = previewWithdraw(assets);

        uint256 actualAssets = _withdraw(assets, shares, receiver, owner);

        if (actualAssets < assets) {
            revert TooFewAssets(assets, actualAssets);
        }
    }
```

    ) public virtual override nonReentrant noNavChange ensureNoNavOps returns (uint256 assets) {
