# Vulnerable to manipulation of the ratio by providing fake timestamps
## Summary
Contract is vulnerable to manipulation of the ratio by providing fake timestamps. The key issue is in the update function. It accepts a queriedTimestamp parameter from the caller, and only verifies that it is greater than the currentRatio.timestamp. This means the caller can provide any timestamp in the future to artificially increase the currentRatio.timestamp.
## Vulnerability Detail
It accepts a queriedTimestamp parameter from the caller
It only verifies that queriedTimestamp is greater than the current timestamp
It sets currentRatio.timestamp to the user-provided queriedTimestamp value

This allows the caller to provide any timestamp in the future, which gets stored as the currentRatio.timestamp.

The key vulnerability is that currentRatio.timestamp is set to a user-controlled value rather than a trusted source like block.timestamp.

The key issue is in the update function. It accepts a queriedTimestamp parameter from the caller, and only verifies that it is greater than the currentRatio.timestamp. This means the caller can provide any timestamp in the future to artificially increase the currentRatio.timestamp.
To manipulate the ratio:
1. The attacker calls update with valid totalAssets and totalLiabilities to set an initial currentRatio.
2. The attacker waits some time for the real time to pass beyond currentRatio.timestamp.
3. The attacker calls update again with the same totalAssets and totalLiabilities, but provides a fake queriedTimestamp far in the future (e.g. 1 year ahead).
4. This sets the currentRatio.timestamp to that fake future timestamp.
5. When current is called, it will return the same ratio but with the fake future timestamp.

## Impact
This allows the attacker to artificially increase the currentRatio.timestamp without actually changing the assets/liabilities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Remove the queriedTimestamp parameter completely.
- In update, set currentRatio.timestamp to block.timestamp instead of a user-provided value.
