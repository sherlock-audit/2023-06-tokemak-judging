# Swap deadline incorrectly set as the block.timestamp
## Summary
[`UniV3Swap.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/UniV3Swap.sol) contracts [`swap()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/UniV3Swap.sol#L46) functionality has deadline parameter incorrectly hardcoded as block.timestamp, as this call allows MEV attacks as mentioned below.


## Vulnerability Detail
Swapper.sol has access to many implemented swapping adapters one such is UniV3Swap.sol contracts `swap()` function which takes deadline parameter, inorder to protect the transaction against MEV attacks; wherein malicious users can keep protocols swap transaction for as long as they wish and execute this signed transaction later, when it is on their advantage.

However in the current implementation of this function call deadline parameter is set to block.timestamp, which defeats the purspose of having the deadline in the first place, as `block.timestamp` will return the current timestamp whenever the transaction is executed and thus passing the deadline check all the time.

[`UniV3Swap.swap#L46-L65`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/UniV3Swap.sol#L46-L65)
```solidity
    function swap(
        address routerAddress,
        address sellTokenAddress,
        uint256 sellAmount,
        address,
        uint256 minBuyAmount,
        bytes memory data
    ) external override onlyRouter returns (uint256) {
        IERC20(sellTokenAddress).safeApprove(routerAddress, sellAmount);


        IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
            path: data,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: minBuyAmount
        });


        return IUniswapV3SwapRouter(routerAddress).exactInput(params);
    }

```
## Impact

## Recommendation
Take deadline as parameter.
