# MaxStakeDuration can be bypassed, allowing an attacker to DOS the GPToke contract
## Summary
Users can bypass MaxStakeDuration and stake toke tokens for longer than 4 years, allowing an attacker to DOS the GPToke contract

## Vulnerability Detail

The GPToke contract has a maximum staking duration of about 4 years shown here: 

```solidity    

uint256 public maxStakeDuration = 1461 days; // default 4 years 

```

https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L31

However it is possible for a user to bypass this with the function extend.

The function extend allows a user to extend the duration of a lockup with the only check made in the nested function previewpoints:

```solidity
if (duration > maxStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooLong(); 
```


https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L185


Previewpoints only checks if the duration parameter passed is less than MaxStakeDuration, and does not check the duration of the current lockup. Meaning that a user for example can stake for 1460 days, and then extend for another 1460 days totaling 8 years. This is because 1460 is less than 1461 listed as the max.

This can result in a possible dangerous scenario where a user can freeze the mint function by repeatedly exploiting the loophole to reach the type(uint256).max limit, where at that point, future prospective users can no longer _mint toke and earn points, causing a permanent DOS.


```solidity
   if (points + totalSupply() > type(uint192).max) {
            revert StakingPointsExceeded();
        }
```

## Impact

Users can bypass MaxStakeDuration due to incorrect input validation and accumulate large amounts of points. A malicious user can abuse this to freeze the mint function, preventing future users from ever participating

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the function previewpoints, check the user's current lockup duration before adding the duration so they cannot extend for more than 4 years
