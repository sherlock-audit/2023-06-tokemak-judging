# Flaw in DestinationVault Withdrawal Logic
## Summary
The `DestinationVault` contract, which is the parent contract of `CurveConvexDestinationVault`, lacks proper validation in the `_ensureLocalUnderlyingBalance` internal function. This oversight could result in potential inconsistencies when withdrawing tokens from the Curve pool and Convex staking contracts, as the function does not check if the requested withdrawal amount exceeds the available balance in the underlying asset contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `DestinationVault` contract includes the `_ensureLocalUnderlyingBalance` internal function, which is used to ensure that the specified balance of the underlying asset (LP token) is available in the vault itself. This function is crucial for handling withdrawals from the Curve pool and Convex staking contracts.

However, the `_ensureLocalUnderlyingBalance` function does not have proper validation to check if the requested withdrawal amount is available in the underlying asset contract. It only checks if the requested amount exceeds the local balance within the vault, which may not accurately reflect the actual available balance in the external contracts.
```solidity
 /// @inheritdoc DestinationVault
    function _ensureLocalUnderlyingBalance(uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
        // We should almost always have our balance of LP tokens in Convex.
        // The exception being a donation we've made.
        // Withdraw from Convex back to this vault for use in a withdrawal
        uint256 curveLpBalance = internalBalance();
        if (amount > curveLpBalance) {//TODO: Possibility of withdrawing a large amount than the one in the curve pool???
            ConvexStaking.withdrawStake(_underlying, convexStaking, amount - curveLpBalance);
        }
    }
```
Here is the relevant code from the `DestinationVault` contract:
```solidity
function withdrawUnderlying(uint256 shares, address to) external onlyLMPVault returns (uint256 amount) {
    // ...

    // Does a balance check, will revert if trying to burn too much
    _burn(msg.sender, shares);

    // This line does not perform adequate validation on the requested withdrawal amount
    _ensureLocalUnderlyingBalance(amount);

    // ...
}
```
## Impact
The lack of proper validation in the `_ensureLocalUnderlyingBalance` function can lead to potential inconsistencies when withdrawing tokens from the Curve pool and Convex staking contracts. If the requested withdrawal amount exceeds the available balance in the underlying asset contract, the function will still execute the withdrawal, resulting in an inconsistent state between the vault's LP token balance and the actual available LP tokens in the external contracts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Before executing the withdrawal operation, the function should verify that the requested amount does not exceed the actual balance in the external contracts (Curve pool and Convex staking). If the requested amount exceeds the available balance, the function should handle the situation gracefully by providing appropriate error messages or revert the transaction to prevent any unintended behavior.
