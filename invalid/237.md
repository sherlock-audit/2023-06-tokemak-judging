# Gas Optimization
Used medium label because there isn't low/informational one.

## Summary
Optimizing the initializations of the for loops to reduce gas usage.

## Vulnerability Detail
In quite a few of the files that are in scope, I've noticed small problems in the initialization loops that only require minor changes, but would save gas.

## Impact
Using more gas that can be easily avoided.

## Code Snippet
I'm only using sample code snippets from the project, but note that the implementations are similar to many of the files. I recommend looking for them globally in the project for example with 'for (') to optimize everywhere.

In the initialization of this for loop we can notice 3 things that will cost us extra gas as follows:
- Setting `i = 0`;
- Taking `.length` from tokens;
- Incrementing with `i++`.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            vm.mockCall(
                address(tokens[i]),
                abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.balanceOf.selector, address(liquidationRow)),
                abi.encode(amounts[i])
            );
        }
```

## Recommendations
To optimize our for loops and reduce their gas usage, we can take the following decisions into consideration:
- Do not set `i = 0;`. This is taking some more gas, which can be avoided - simply say `uint256 i;`. This way, the default value of `uint256`, which is 0, will be assigned to `i` and we don't need `i = 0` anymore;
- Do not take `.length` for each loop of the for loop. By using `.length`, we make the for loop calculating the array's length everytime a new loop is started. Store the array's length in a variable and use it instead;
- Do not use `i++` as it is not gas efficient as well. Use `++i` instead.
- Please consider these changes and follow them to avoid unnecessary use of extra gas.
