# The notifyRewardAmount function can set the rewardRate eqaul to zero
## Summary

The [notifyRewardAmount function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L274) of the AbstractRewarder contract is invoked by the [queueNewRewards function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L235) to allow for the contract to distribute the received reward tokens for the current reward period. However, there are no checks in place to ensure that the [`reward`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L274C33-L274C47) parameter is greater than zero which  would cause the [`rewardRate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L285) to be equal to zero over the new period. This would cause user funds not to accrue rewards over the given period.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [notifyRewardAmount function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L274) has no logic to assert that the `reward` parameter is greater than zero which, if equal to zero, would cause the [rewardRate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L285) to be set set to zero.

## Impact

The lack of assertion that the `reward` parameter is equal to zero will allow for the `rewardRate` to potentially be set to zero for a given period. This may be done either on accident, or on purpose, when a whitelisted address invokes the [queueNewRewards function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L235) and the notifyRewardAmount function is invoked with a [`newRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L235C30-L235C48) parameter equal to zero. This will cause user funds to be idle for the given period because they will not accrue rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

As a mitigation, it is recommended to refactor the [queueNewRewards function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L235) to assert that the `newRewards` parameter is equal to zero and revert with a custom error if true. This can be done by refactoring the queueNewRewards function as follows:
```solidity
    function queueNewRewards(uint256 newRewards) external onlyWhitelisted {
        // @audit recommended mitigation
        if(newRewards == 0) revert NewRewardsZero();

        uint256 startingQueuedRewards = queuedRewards;
        uint256 startingNewRewards = newRewards;

        newRewards += startingQueuedRewards;

        if (block.number >= periodInBlockFinish) {c
            notifyRewardAmount(newRewards);
            queuedRewards = 0;
        } else {
            uint256 elapsedBlock = block.number - (periodInBlockFinish - durationInBlock);
            uint256 currentAtNow = rewardRate * elapsedBlock;
            uint256 queuedRatio = currentAtNow * 1000 / newRewards;

            if (queuedRatio < newRewardRatio) {
                notifyRewardAmount(newRewards);
                queuedRewards = 0;
            } else {
                queuedRewards = newRewards;
            }
        }

        emit QueuedRewardsUpdated(startingQueuedRewards, startingNewRewards, queuedRewards);

        // Transfer the new rewards from the caller to this contract.
        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);
    }
```
Given the contract's current logic, this will ensure that the notifyRewardAmount function is always invoked with a `reward` parameter that is greater than zero.
