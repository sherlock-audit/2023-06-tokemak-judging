# Read-Only Reentrancy in `getPriceInEth` Function
## Summary
The `getPriceInEth` function, responsible for calculating the price of a token in terms of Ether, contains a potential reentrancy vulnerability due to the conditional invocation of an external contract's function within a loop. This could open the door for an attacker to exploit reentrancy and potentially disrupt the oracle's operation.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the provided `getPriceInEth` function, there's a section of code that checks if the current token being iterated is the ETH token and if a specific condition holds true:
```solidity
if (iToken == LibAdapter.CURVE_REGISTRY_ETH_ADDRESS_POINTER) {
    if (poolInfo.checkReentrancy == 1) {
        // This will fail in reentrancy
        ICurveOwner(pool.owner()).withdraw_admin_fees(address(pool));
    }
}
```
The purpose of this code appears to be related to reentrancy protection; however, the interaction with the external contract `ICurveOwner` can potentially lead to reentrant calls. The loop iterates through tokens, and if the ETH token is encountered and the reentrancy condition is met, the external function `withdraw_admin_fees` is invoked. If this external function has reentrancy vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit it to perform reentrant calls back into the oracle contract.
## Impact
If an attacker successfully exploits the reentrancy vulnerability, they could potentially disrupt the intended operation of the oracle contract. They might manipulate state changes in a way that the oracle's data becomes inconsistent, leading to incorrect price calculations or even causing the oracle to become temporarily unavailable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Separate external interactions from the loop's iterative process. Gather all necessary data and perform checks within the loop, and then execute external contract interactions after the loop's completion. This "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern can help prevent reentrancy vulnerabilities by ensuring that external interactions are controlled and not susceptible to manipulation due to iterative processes.
