# clearExtraRewards can inadvertently cause loss of external rewards if called prematurely
## Summary
The clearExtraRewards function could lead to inadvertent loss of access to external rewards if called prematurely
## Vulnerability Detail
The key parts are [Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L68). This deletes the entire extraRewards array. If called accidentally or prematurely, it would remove all connected reward contracts. Users would no longer be able to claim rewards from them. If there were valuable reward contracts in the array that were meant to be long term, calling clearExtraRewards() would cut off access.

For example:
1. User has staked tokens and earned EXTRA_TOKEN rewards
2. extraRewards array contains address of ExtraRewarder contract
3. Admin calls clearExtraRewards
4. extraRewards array is cleared
Now there is no way to claim the EXTRA_TOKEN rewards, they are locked in the external contract forever.

## Impact
If this is called while external reward contracts still hold funds, it will delete the references to claim them

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A better approach is to make removing individual rewards explicit instead of clearing the entire array
