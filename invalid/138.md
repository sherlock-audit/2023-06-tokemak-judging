# FRAX / ETH chainlink oracle has too long of heartbeat and deviation threshold which can cause loss of funds
## Summary
`SfrxEthEthOracle.sol` uses the `FRAX / ETH` chainlink oracle to calculate the current debt value of `LMPVault.sol`.  `FRAX / ETH` has a 24 hour heartbeat and a 2% deviation threshold. This deviation in price could cause loss of funds to the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
The user sends a withdraw transaction to receive 10 wETH from `LMPVault.sol`. Assume that `LMPVault.sol` only has one connected `DestinationVault.sol` and the liquidity token is `frxETH`.

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L73

Now, by `_calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn` method, the contract will calculate how much frxETH should gets burn in order to supply 10 wETH to the user. In this method, the contract is using the _debtValue method to determine the value of `LMPVault.sol` shares.

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L328

FRAX / ETH oracle has a 24 hour hearbeat and 2% deviation threshold, this means that the price can move up to 2% or 24 hours before a price update is triggered. now if `_debtValue` of `LMPVault.sol` becomes `2%` more than actual value, the lower amount of `frxETH` needs to get burn in order to supply 10 wETH to the user. this amount can be `ActualAmountOffrxETH - 2%`. the result is that the on-chain value could be much different than the true value.

So, `DestinationVault.sol` will burn the value of `ActualAmountOffrxETH - 2%` and will get lower amounts of wETH. This can cause that withdraw transaction from the user to get reverted in the :

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L102

At all, `LMPVault.sol.withdraw` method will not work because `actualAssets` always will be lower than `assets`. for example when you remove liquidity from Curve, there is some lose in transaction.

## Impact
The user can't use `withdraw` method and the only option is to use `redeem`.  In the `redeem` user needs to accept almost 2% lose in order to process the withdrawal process successfully. 

Of course, the user can wait up to 24 hours, but it is not clear whether user can prevent this loss after 24 hours and most importantly, the user does not know the cause of this loss and has to accept the loss without being informed.

The user can unfairly lose part of their funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe use of the FRAX / USD oracle can help. it has a 1-hour heartbeat and a 1% deviation threshold.
