# The `rewardToken` can not be transferred from the AbstractRewarder#`_getReward()` to the user directly, which lead to that the user fail to claim the `rewardToken`
## Summary
The `rewardToken` can not be transferred from the AbstractRewarder#`_getReward()` to the user directly, which lead to that the user fail to claim the `rewardToken` and therefore the user can not receive the `rewardToken` even if they are qualified to claim and receive the `rewardToken`. 

(NOTE：In this case, the `rewardToken` would be any reward token besides $TOKE)


## Vulnerability Detail

Within the LMPVault contract, the `rewarder`, which is the contract instance of the MainRewarder would be defined like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L101
```solidity
    /// @notice Main rewarder for this contract
    IMainRewarder public rewarder;
```

When a user want to claim their rewards, the user call the LMPVault#`claimRewards()`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L540-L542

Within the LMPVault#`claimRewards()`, the MainRewarder#`getReward()` would be called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L541
```solidity
    function claimRewards() public whenNotPaused {
        rewarder.getReward(msg.sender, true); /// @audit
    }
```

Within the the MainRewarder#`getReward()`,  the MainRewarder#`_processRewards()` would be called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L105
```solidity
    function getReward(address account, bool claimExtras) external nonReentrant {
        if (msg.sender != address(stakeTracker) && msg.sender != account) {
            revert Errors.AccessDenied();
        }
        _updateReward(account);
        _processRewards(account, claimExtras); /// @audit
    }
```

Within the MainRewarder#`_processRewards()`, the AbstractRewarder#`_getReward()` would be called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L109
```solidity
    function _processRewards(address account, bool claimExtras) internal {
        _getReward(account);
        ...
    }
```

Within the AbstractRewarder#`_getReward()`, if the `rewardToken` would not be the $TOKE's address (`rewardToken != tokeAddress`), or $TOKE's staking is turned off by `duration = 0` (`tokeLockDuration == 0`), the rewardTokens would just be sent back to the `account` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L366-L368
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Internal function to distribute rewards to a specific account.
     * @param account The address of the user to distribute rewards to.
     */
    function _getReward(address account) internal {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(account, "account");

        uint256 reward = earned(account);
        (IGPToke gpToke, address tokeAddress) = (systemRegistry.gpToke(), address(systemRegistry.toke()));

        // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
        if (reward == 0) return;

        rewards[account] = 0;
        emit RewardPaid(account, reward);

        // if NOT toke, or staking is turned off (by duration = 0), just send reward back
        if (rewardToken != tokeAddress || tokeLockDuration == 0) { /// @audit
            IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(account, reward); /// @audit
        } else { 
            // authorize gpToke to get our reward Toke
            // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
            IERC20(address(tokeAddress)).approve(address(gpToke), reward);

            // stake Toke
            gpToke.stake(reward, tokeLockDuration, account);
        }
    }
```

According the ["End-Users View"](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/README.md#end-users-view), if the reward token would not be the $TOKE, these reward token would be sent directly to the user like this: 
>_Any other reward token is sent directly to the user._

And then, the MainRewarder (which the AbstractRewarder is inherited) is **not** supposed to hold any amount of the `rewardToken`.
In addition to that, within the both contracts (the MainRewarder and the AbstractRewarder), there is no function that the `rewardToken` is deposited or transferred into the MainRewarder (AbstractRewarder) contract.

However, within the AbstractRewarder#`_getReward()`above, the IERC20(rewardToken)#`safeTransfer()` would be used to transfer the `rewardToken` to the user (`account`) directly from the MainRewarder (AbstractRewarder) contract like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L367-L368
```solidity
        if (rewardToken != tokeAddress || tokeLockDuration == 0) {
            IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(account, reward); /// @audit
            ...
```

This transfer above would be impossible. Because the MainRewarder (which the AbstractRewarder is inherited) is **not** supposed to hold any amount of the `rewardToken` and within the both contracts (the MainRewarder and the AbstractRewarder), there is no function that the `rewardToken` is deposited or transferred into the MainRewarder (AbstractRewarder) contract.

As a result, the user fail to claim the `rewardToken` and therefore the user can not receive the `rewardToken` even if they are qualified to claim and receive the `rewardToken`. 


## Impact
The user fail to claim the `rewardToken` and therefore the user can not receive the `rewardToken` even if they are qualified to claim and receive the `rewardToken`. 

(NOTE：In this case, the `rewardToken` would be any reward token besides $TOKE)

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
Within the AbstractRewarder#`_getReward()`, consider adding a deposit function in order to deposit the amount (`reward`) of the `rewardToken` into the MainRewarder (AbstractRewarder) contract from the caller (`msg.sender`), who is a whitelisted-operator, if the `rewardToken` balance of the MainRewarder (AbstractRewarder) contract would be insufficient like this:
And then calling the IERC20(rewardToken)#`safeTransfer()` via the AbstractRewarder#`_getReward()` like this:
```solidity
+   function _depositRewardTokens(address rewardToken, uint256 amount) internal onlyWhitelisted {
+.      IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
+   {
...

    function _getReward(address account) internal {
         ...
         if (rewardToken != tokeAddress || tokeLockDuration == 0) {
+           If (IERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this) < reward) {            
+               _depositRewardTokens(rewardToken, reward);
+           }
+           require(IERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this) >= reward), "This rewarder must hold sufficient balance of rewardToken)");
            IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(account, reward);
            ...
```
