# Possible Front-Running Attack on Deposit Function in LMPVault.sol
## Summary
This contract allows an attacker to manipulate the number of shares minted and profit at the expense of the first honest depositor. The attack exploits rounding issues in the computation for minted shares, leading to a discrepancy between the expected and actual number of shares received by the depositor.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerable smart contract includes three functions related to the deposit process: `maxDeposit`, `previewDeposit`, and `deposit`. The `maxDeposit` function calculates the maximum number of assets that can be deposited by a given wallet. The `previewDeposit` function computes the number of shares to be minted for a given amount of assets. The `deposit` function is responsible for executing the deposit transaction, but it is vulnerable to front-running.
```solidity
 /// @dev See {IERC4626-maxDeposit}.
    function maxDeposit(address wallet) public view virtual override returns (uint256 maxAssets) {
        maxAssets = convertToAssets(_maxMint(wallet));
    }

    /// @dev See {IERC4626-previewDeposit}.
    function previewDeposit(uint256 assets) public view virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, Math.Rounding.Down);
    }

    function deposit(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver
    ) public virtual override nonReentrant noNavChange ensureNoNavOps returns (uint256 shares) {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(assets, "assets");
        if (assets > maxDeposit(receiver)) {
            revert ERC4626DepositExceedsMax(assets, maxDeposit(receiver));
        }

        shares = previewDeposit(assets);

        _transferAndMint(assets, shares, receiver);
    }
```
Attack Scenario:
1. The attacker monitors the blockchain for a legitimate deposit transaction from a victim to the `VulnerableContract` contract.
2. As soon as the attacker spots the victim's transaction in the mempool, they quickly submit their own transaction to the same `VulnerableContract` contract with a slightly lower amount of assets (e.g., 1 asset less).
3. The attacker's transaction gets mined first, and the contract's `previewDeposit` function calculates the number of shares to be minted based on the attacker's manipulated assets amount. Due to rounding issues, the `previewDeposit` function returns a lower number of shares than the expected value for the victim's deposit.
4. When the victim's transaction is mined, they receive fewer shares than anticipated, leading to a loss in the number of shares they were entitled to.
5. The attacker can now proceed to withdraw their assets, including the extra assets they sent in their attack transaction, exploiting the inflated share price, and making a profit at the expense of the honest depositor.
## Impact
The attack allows an attacker to send a transaction to the contract just before a legitimate depositor's transaction is processed. By manipulating the number of assets and triggering rounding discrepancies in the `previewDeposit` function, the attacker can cause the honest depositor to receive fewer shares than expected. This results in the attacker profiting at the expense of the honest user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the front-running attack and the rounding issues, a simple and effective solution is to adjust the initial mint during the first deposit (when totalSupply is zero). Instead of minting all shares directly to the recipient, a portion of the initial mint should be burned by minting shares to a dead address (e.g., address zero). The remaining shares can then be minted and allocated to the recipient.
```solidity
// Define the INITIAL_BURN_AMOUNT constant.
uint256 constant INITIAL_BURN_AMOUNT = 1000;

function deposit(
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver
) public virtual override nonReentrant noNavChange ensureNoNavOps returns (uint256 shares) {
    Errors.verifyNotZero(assets, "assets");
    if (assets > maxDeposit(receiver)) {
        revert ERC4626DepositExceedsMax(assets, maxDeposit(receiver));
    }

    // Burn INITIAL_BURN_AMOUNT shares to a dead address.
    _mint(address(0), INITIAL_BURN_AMOUNT);

    // Mint (assets - INITIAL_BURN_AMOUNT) shares to the recipient.
    shares = previewDeposit(assets - INITIAL_BURN_AMOUNT);

    _transferAndMint(assets, shares, receiver);
}

```
