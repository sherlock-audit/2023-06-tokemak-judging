# Multiple Unbounded loops
## Summary
The use of Multiple Unbounded loops in a function

## Vulnerability Detail
In this function, a loop is utilized on `extraRewards` to facilitate reward withdrawal. Subsequently, in the \_processRewards function, if the claim is validated as true, another unbounded loop is executed. This could potentially result in the function becoming increasingly costly to invoke over time, particularly when the `extraRewards` reach a certain length.

## Impact
Possible DOS under conditions or high gas cost

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _processRewards(address account, bool claimExtras) internal {
        _getReward(account);

        //also get rewards from linked rewards
        if (claimExtras) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < extraRewards.length; ++i) {
                IExtraRewarder(extraRewards[i]).getReward(account);
            }
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Incorporate a mechanism within the withdrawal function to guarantee that the loop executes a maximum of one time, irrespective of other functionalities.
- Limit the length of the input arrays
