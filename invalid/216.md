# Oracle Returns Incorrect Price During Flash Crashes
## Summary
Chainlink price feeds have in-built minimum & maximum prices they will return; if during a flash crash, bridge compromise, or depegging event, an asset’s value falls below the price feed’s minimum price, the oracle price feed will continue to report the (now incorrect) minimum price.

## Vulnerability Detail
Note there is only a check for price to be non-negative, and not within an acceptable range
```solidity
if (roundId == 0 || price <= 0 || updatedAt == 0 || updatedAt > timestamp
                || updatedAt < timestamp - tokenPricingTimeout
        ) revert InvalidDataReturned();
```

## Impact
An attacker could:
- buy that asset using a decentralized exchange at the very low price,
- deposit the asset into a Lending / Borrowing platform using Chainlink’s price feeds,
- borrow against that asset at the minimum price Chainlink’s price feed returns, even though the actual price is far lower.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Cross-check the returned answer against the minPrice/maxPrice and revert if the answer is outside of these bounds:
```solidity
  if (price >= maxPrice or price <= minPrice) revert();
```
This ensures that a false price will not be returned if the underlying asset's value hits the minPrice.
