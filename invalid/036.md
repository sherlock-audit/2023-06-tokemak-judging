# Attacker can steal generated yields using flashloan attack
## Summary
Attacker can steal generated yields using flashloan attack. This is because rewards are claimed only on withdraws/rebalance and attacker can deposit huge amount, then initiate rewards claiming and then witdraw.
## Vulnerability Detail
Each destination vault [has rewarder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVaultFactory.sol#L78-L85). This rewarder is used to claim rewards. `DestinationVault` will accrued rewards for caller(which is LMPVault always) only [when tokens are moving](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L335-L353). In such cases all accrued rewards by vault [will be withdrawn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L73-L84) in form of base asset.

When users deposit to `LMPVault`, then these deposited funds sit in the contract until next rebalance, when they can be used. So in case of deposits, no funds are accrued.

This allows attacker to track when enough funds has accrued in the destination vault rewarded and then make flashloan, deposit funds to the `LMPVault`, then withdraw 1 share to claim rewards and increase exchange rate and then withdraw all his shares, repay flashloan and take profit. Using such approach attacker can grab big part of rewards, while other user will loose them.
## Impact
Loss of yields.

## Recommendation
You need to claim rewards before each deposit/withdraw to have correct exchange rate.
