# Precision Loss in Price Calculation due to Floating-Point Arithmetic in `getPriceInEth` function leading to inaccurate price of wstETH token
## Summary
The smart contract `WstETHEthOracle` contains a vulnerability related to precision loss in price calculations. The vulnerability arises from the use of floating-point arithmetic to calculate prices, which can lead to inaccurate results due to the limitations of fixed-point arithmetic in Solidity.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is present in the `getPriceInEth` function of the `WstETHEthOracle` contract, where the `wstETH` token price in terms of Ether (ETH) is calculated. The following calculation is performed:
```solidity
price = (wstETH.stEthPerToken() * stETHPrice) / stETHPrecision;
```
1. `wstETH.stEthPerToken()` retrieves the price of stETH in terms of wstETH tokens.
2. `stETHPrice` is the price of stETH in terms of Ether (ETH).
3. `stETHPrecision` represents the precision factor of stETH.
The calculation involves multiplication and division, and since Solidity uses fixed-point arithmetic, precision loss can occur. The multiplication may result in numbers with fractional parts that cannot be accurately represented as integers. Division may further exacerbate this issue, leading to potential rounding errors and loss of accuracy.
## Impact
The vulnerability exposes the potential for distorted price information to be provided by the contract. This could result in misinformed financial decisions by users or other smart contracts relying on the accuracy of the price data. If left unmitigated, this could lead to suboptimal trading strategies, incorrect asset valuations, and disruptions in automated processes that rely on precise price conversions. While the immediate financial consequences might not be severe, the overall trustworthiness of the contract's price oracle functionality could be compromised, affecting the contract's intended utility within the ecosystem.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Employ fixed-point arithmetic libraries or techniques. One approach is to scale up the numbers involved in the calculations by multiplying them by a large precision factor before performing operations. This ensures that fractional parts are preserved during the calculations.
```solidity
uint256 scaledPrice = (wstETH.stEthPerToken() * stETHPrice * SCALE_FACTOR) / stETHPrecision;
price = scaledPrice / SCALE_FACTOR;
```
