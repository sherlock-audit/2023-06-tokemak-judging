# Lack of Initialization Check in initialize Function Leading to Potential Reinitialization
## Summary
The initialize function in the contract lacks proper checks or an initializer modifier in case of base initialize is not called, which exposes it to potential reinitialization attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to call the initialize function multiple times, potentially causing unexpected behavior, security vulnerabilities, or unauthorized changes to the contract's state.


## Vulnerability Detail
The initialize function in the contract lacks a mechanism to prevent it from being executed more than once. This means that after the contract is initially initialized, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the initialize function in case of base initialize is not called, potentially causing unintended consequences or compromising the contract's security.


## Impact
Manipulate contract state: An attacker might maliciously modify the contract's state, leading to unexpected behavior, loss of funds, or unauthorized access to sensitive functions.

    function initialize(
        IERC20 baseAsset_,
        IERC20 underlyer_,
        IMainRewarder rewarder_,
        address[] memory additionalTrackedTokens_,
        bytes memory params_
    ) public virtual override {
        // Base class has the initializer() modifier to prevent double-setup
        // If you don't call the base initialize, make sure you protect this call
        super.initialize(baseAsset_, underlyer_, rewarder_, additionalTrackedTokens_, params_);
    ...
    }

    function initialize(
        IERC20 baseAsset_,
        IERC20 underlyer_,
        IMainRewarder rewarder_,
        address[] memory additionalTrackedTokens_,
        bytes memory params_
    ) public virtual override {
        // Base class has the initializer() modifier to prevent double-setup
        // If you don't call the base initialize, make sure you protect this call
        super.initialize(baseAsset_, underlyer_, rewarder_, additionalTrackedTokens_, params_);
    ...
    }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an initializer modifier to the initialize function to ensure that it can only be executed once. This modifier should check whether the contract has been initialized before allowing the function to proceed.
