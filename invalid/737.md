# PeripheryPayments.refundETH has no access control
## Summary

Surely, only project owners should have access to excess ETH in the contract

## Vulnerability Detail

PeripheryPayments.sol has the `receive() external payable { }` function. This means users could potentially transfer unaccounted ETH to the contract

It would make sense that only system administrators could recover these funds, but the `refundETH` has no access control.

## Impact

All of the excess funds in the PeripheryPayments can be claimed by anyone.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function refundETH() external payable {
    if (address(this).balance > 0) Address.sendValue(payable(msg.sender), address(this).balance);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only allow the owners to access the `refundETH` function.

Or add accounting and only return funds of the msg.sender, not the whole balance.
