# Convex admin can steal funds
## Summary
From the README, we know that the administrators of the protocols that Tokemak integrates with are not trusted. However, the issue at hand is that Convex administrators can execute certain steps and potentially pilfer Curve LP tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability consists of the following steps:
1. Create a fake gauge for an existing pool and create an Curve DAO proposal to add said fake gauge
2. Pass Curve DAO proposal undetected (7 day voting period) (If you think that this is not possible, recall the Tornado Cash hack, where a malicious proposal was overlooked by many users and subsequently enacted )
3. Give the fake gauge weight on Curve's gauge controller.
4. Shutdown an existing legit Convex pool. (Curve LP tokens are unstaked and returned to Booster contract)
5. Add a new pool on Convex that uses the fake gauge but legitimate LP tokens
6. Loop fake liquidity onto the gauge to increase Convex Deposit Tokens (deposit, withdraw directly from gauge, deposit again)
7. Call shutdownSystem() on Pool Manager Secondary Proxy. New pools can no longer be added
8. Call queueForceShutdown() on Booster Owner. A normal shutdown call will fail with the fake pool as there are more Convex 9. Deposit Tokens than there are LP tokens, thus need to use this timelock shutdown feature.
10. Wait 30 days for the timelock to complete
11. Call forceShutdownSystem() on Booster Owner
12. Withdraw real Curve LP tokens using the illegitimate Convex Deposit Tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The only way to mitigate this issue is to not integrate with the Convex protocol
