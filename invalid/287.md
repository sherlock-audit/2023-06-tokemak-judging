# ETH balance can be manipulated to wrongly wrap ETH into WETH
## Summary
The wrapping of received ETH into WETH assumes the ETH amount matches the balance. The balance could be manipulated to wrongly wrap ETH. 
## Vulnerability Detail 
The key vulnerable code is [link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/CurveV2FactoryCryptoAdapter.sol#L150-L154). This assumes that actualAmounts[ethIndex] matches the actual ETH balance received. However, actualAmounts[ethIndex] is determined by [link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/CurveV2FactoryCryptoAdapter.sol#L146-L148)
The coinsBalancesBefore and coinsBalancesAfter can be manipulated by an attacker contract calling this function. For example, an attacker contract could:

- Set coinsBalancesBefore[ethIndex] to 0 ETH
- Call removeLiquidity, receiving 1 ETH
- Set coinsBalancesAfter[ethIndex] to 10 ETH
- _compareCoinsBalances will see a balance increase of 10 ETH
- actualAmounts[ethIndex] will be set to 10 ETH
The code will wrongly wrap 10 ETH into WETH, even though only 1 ETH was received
## Impact
This allows the attacker to wrongly drain ETH from the contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract should rely on the actually received ETH balance rather than the recorded balances:
