# Rewards are lost every time we try to update the reward amount.
## Summary
Reward leakage happens due to rounding down in calculation of rewardRate. The leakage will happen over the duration of the protocol whenever rewards are being updated.

## Vulnerability Detail
Reward rate is calculated as `reward / durationInBlock`. The `leftover` in the contract is calculated based on previous reward rate by `remaining * rewardRate`.

For instance, if `reward == 1000` and `durationInBlock == 126`, each time `notifyRewardAmount()` is called, about ~0.9365 reward is lost.

## Impact
Rewards are lost every time we try to update the reward amount.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider tracking how much reward is left instead of calculating leftover by `remaining * rewardRate`.
