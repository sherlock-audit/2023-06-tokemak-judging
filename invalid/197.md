# Reentrancy Vulnerability in GPToke Smart Contract
## Summary
The GPToke smart contract, specifically within its _stake, extend, and unstake functions, has been identified to contain a high-risk vulnerability related to reentrancy. This vulnerability arises due to the presence of external calls followed by state changes, which can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the contract's state and potentially drain funds or perform unauthorized actions.
## Vulnerability Detail
Reentrancy attacks occur when an external contract is called and before the function is completed, the external contract calls back into the calling contract. In the GPToke contract, the functions _stake, extend, and unstake have external calls and subsequent state changes, making them susceptible to such attacks. Specifically, the vulnerability is observed in the following segments:

 _stake(uint256,uint256,address) function, where external calls like _collectRewards(to,false) and weth.safeTransfer(user,totalClaiming) are made before state variables like _mint(to,points) are written.

Cross-function reentrancies are possible using the _balances and lockups state variables. For instance, ERC20._balances can be used in functions like ERC20._burn(address,uint256) and ERC20._mint(address,uint256).
## Impact
If exploited, this vulnerability can lead to:

1.Unauthorized changes to the contract's state.
2.Potential loss of funds for users or the contract itself.
3.Manipulation of token balances and supply.
## Code Snippet
The following are the relevant code snippets where the vulnerability is observed:

_stake function(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L98):

```solidity

function _stake(uint256 amount, uint256 duration, address to) internal whenNotPaused {
    ...
    _collectRewards(to, false);
    ...
    _mint(to, points);
}
```
extend function(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L158):

```solidity

function extend(uint256 lockupId, uint256 duration) external whenNotPaused {
    ...
    _collectRewards(msg.sender, false);
    ...
    _mint(msg.sender, newPoints - oldPoints);
}
```
unstake function(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L129):

```solidity

function unstake(uint256 lockupId) external whenNotPaused {
    ...
    _collectRewards(msg.sender, false);
    ...
    toke.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability:

1.Implement a reentrancy guard: A common practice is to use a mutex or a state variable that locks the contract while a function is being executed. This prevents nested calls until the function is fully executed.

2.Ensure state changes before external calls: Reorder the operations so that all state changes occur before any external calls. This ensures that even if a reentrancy attack occurs, the state is already updated and cannot be manipulated further.

3.Regularly audit and test the contract: Ensure that the contract undergoes regular audits and testing to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities.

By implementing these recommendations, the GPToke contract can be safeguarded against potential reentrancy attacks and ensure the security of its users and funds.
