# Curve related oracle's means of preventing reentrant may result in revert
## Summary

Curve has a well-known readability reentrant problem, and this protocol is designed to take this into account and add corresponding function calls to detect reentrant status.
There are three most commonly used functions: remove_liquidity / claim_admin_fees / withdraw_admin_fees. This protocol supports the latter two types of oracle.
The problem is that for some curve pools, claim_admin_fees / withdraw_admin_fees are only allowed to be called by the owner, which results in oracle reading the price revert and not being usable.

## Vulnerability Detail

Take ETH/stETH [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdc24316b9ae028f1497c275eb9192a3ea0f67022#code) for example, withdraw_admin_fees is only allowed to be called by the owner.
```vyper
@external
@nonreentrant('lock')
def withdraw_admin_fees():
    assert msg.sender == self.owner  # dev: only owner

    amount: uint256 = self.admin_balances[0]
    if amount != 0:
        raw_call(msg.sender, b"", value=amount)

    amount = self.admin_balances[1]
    if amount != 0:
        assert ERC20(self.coins[1]).transfer(msg.sender, amount)

    self.admin_balances = empty(uint256[N_COINS])
```

## Impact

For ETH related curve pools, reentrant detection needs to be carried out to avoid oracle price manipulation. 
However, the related function claim_admin_fees / withdraw_admin_fees may only allow the owner to call, resulting in revert, and the oracle cannot work normally.
