# SwapRouter can receive ETH but has no withdraw or wrap function for it
## Summary

The **`SwapRouter`** contract includes a **`receive()`** function to accept incoming Ether and unwrap Wrapped Ether (WETH). However, there is no corresponding logic to withdraw or handle this Ether.

## Vulnerability Detail

The **`SwapRouter`** contract have a **`receive()`** function to accept ETH and unwrap WETH.

```solidity
    receive() external payable {
        // we accept ETH so we can unwrap WETH
    }
```

However, the contract lacks any logic to handle received ETH. This could lead to Ether being stuck within the contract, as there is no way provided to retrieve it.

## Impact

Ether sent to the **`SwapRouter`** contract will become inaccessible and stuck within the contract indefinitely.
