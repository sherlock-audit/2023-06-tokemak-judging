# CurveV1StableSwap use ETH but is not payable nor receivable
## Summary
`swap()` function of CurveV1StableSwap.sol is not payable but use native token

## Vulnerability Detail
 `swap()` function of CurveV1StableSwap.sol is not payable  but use native token ,moreover the full contract can't receive native token : 
```solidity
    //E Swaps sellToken for buyToken, only from swapRouter.sol
    function swap(
        address poolAddress, //E pool The address of the pool for the swapper
        address sellTokenAddress, //E sellTokenAddress The address of the token to sell
        uint256 sellAmount, //E sellAmount The amount of sellToken to sell
        address buyTokenAddress, //E buyTokenAddress The address of the token to buy
        uint256 minBuyAmount, //E minBuyAmount The minimum amount of buyToken expected
        bytes memory data //E Additional data used differently by the different swappers
    ) external override onlyRouter returns (uint256 amount) {
        (int128 sellIndex, int128 buyIndex, bool isEth) = abi.decode(data, (int128, int128, bool));
        //E fetch pool
        ICurveV1StableSwap pool = ICurveV1StableSwap(poolAddress);
        //E approve tokens for swap
        IERC20(sellTokenAddress).safeApprove(poolAddress, sellAmount);
        //E swap tokens
        amount = pool.exchange(sellIndex, buyIndex, sellAmount, minBuyAmount);

        // The rest of the system only deals in WETH
        //E deposit eth to get weth 
        if (isEth && buyTokenAddress == address(weth)) {
            weth.deposit{ value: amount }(); //E @audit non payable contract
        }
    }
```

## Impact
Even though it is used through `delegateCall`, this function should be payable and the contract should be able to receive native token to prevent native token error or misunderstanding in the future

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a `receive()` function on this contract and make `swap()` function payable
