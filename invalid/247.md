# Inconsistent Logic between _runDeposit and _runWithdrawal Functions
## Summary
inconsistent logic in the `_runDeposit`  and `_runWithdrawal` functions, both functions share the same conditional checks for `nTokens,` the operations inside these conditions are different. This inconsistency creates an opening for malicious manipulation, leading to unintended behavior during liquidity addition or removal.
## Vulnerability Detail
This is how the `_runDeposit` functions looks like:
```solidity
  function _runDeposit(
        uint256[] memory amounts,
        uint256 minLpMintAmount,
        address poolAddress,
        bool useEth
    ) private returns (uint256 deployed) {
        uint256 nTokens = amounts.length;
        ICryptoSwapPool pool = ICryptoSwapPool(poolAddress);
        if (useEth) {
            // slither-disable-start arbitrary-send-eth
            if (nTokens == 2) {
                uint256[2] memory staticParamArray = [amounts[0], amounts[1]];
                deployed = pool.add_liquidity{ value: amounts[0] }(staticParamArray, minLpMintAmount);
            } else if (nTokens == 3) {
                uint256[3] memory staticParamArray = [amounts[0], amounts[1], amounts[2]];
                deployed = pool.add_liquidity{ value: amounts[0] }(staticParamArray, minLpMintAmount);
            } else if (nTokens == 4) {
                uint256[4] memory staticParamArray = [amounts[0], amounts[1], amounts[2], amounts[3]];
                deployed = pool.add_liquidity{ value: amounts[0] }(staticParamArray, minLpMintAmount);
            }
            // slither-disable-end arbitrary-send-eth
        } else {
            if (nTokens == 2) {
                uint256[2] memory staticParamArray = [amounts[0], amounts[1]];
                deployed = pool.add_liquidity(staticParamArray, minLpMintAmount);
            } else if (nTokens == 3) {
                uint256[3] memory staticParamArray = [amounts[0], amounts[1], amounts[2]];
                deployed = pool.add_liquidity(staticParamArray, minLpMintAmount);
            } else if (nTokens == 4) {
                uint256[4] memory staticParamArray = [amounts[0], amounts[1], amounts[2], amounts[3]];
                deployed = pool.add_liquidity(staticParamArray, minLpMintAmount);
            }
        }
        if (deployed < minLpMintAmount) {
            revert LibAdapter.MinLpAmountNotReached();
        }
    }
```

`_runWithdrawal` function:
```solidity
function _runWithdrawal(address poolAddress, uint256[] memory amounts, uint256 maxLpBurnAmount) private {
        uint256 nTokens = amounts.length;
        ICryptoSwapPool pool = ICryptoSwapPool(poolAddress);
        if (nTokens == 2) {
            uint256[2] memory staticParamArray = [amounts[0], amounts[1]];
            pool.remove_liquidity(maxLpBurnAmount, staticParamArray);
        } else if (nTokens == 3) {
            uint256[3] memory staticParamArray = [amounts[0], amounts[1], amounts[2]];
            pool.remove_liquidity(maxLpBurnAmount, staticParamArray);
        } else if (nTokens == 4) {
            uint256[4] memory staticParamArray = [amounts[0], amounts[1], amounts[2], amounts[3]];
            pool.remove_liquidity(maxLpBurnAmount, staticParamArray);
        }
    }

}
```
- the inconsistency in logic between _runDeposit and _runWithdrawal functions could lead to unintended minting of LP tokens3
- so an attacker would create a malicious token with an arbitrary number of decimals, manipulating the minting calculations. By using this token, they could trick the system into minting more LP tokens than intended, leading to imbalanced rewards and financial manipulation.
-  and here is a The Attack Path:
- The attacker, crafts a malicious token with an arbitrary number of decimals. This token, a vile concoction, will twist the very foundations of the  system.
- the malefactor calls upon _runDeposit, exploiting the discrepancy in the conditional checks. The arbitrary decimals throw off the minting calculations.
- As the system  genuflects to the deceptive token, it mints more LP tokens than intended, like a pretenders flooding the market with forged currency.
- This imbalance disrupts rewards, swaying the equilibrium of the realm, leaving users baffled and ensnared in wicked web.
## Impact
this vulnerability can result  incorrect calculations, unintended minting of LP tokens, or value transfers. This lead to disrupt the balance of the platform, and leading to financial  losses for users.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
 review  the conditional checks and logic fot both, _runDeposit and _runWithdrawal functions. and  Verify nTokens and its corresponding operations are identical, to preventing attackers from exploiting the inconsistency.
