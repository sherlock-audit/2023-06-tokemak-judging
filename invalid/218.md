# Missing Check for Existing Vault in `createVault` Function
## Summary
The `createVault` function in the `LMPVaultFactory` contract lacks a check to verify whether the newly generated `newVaultAddress` already exists in the `vaultRegistry`. This omission could potentially lead to unintended overwriting of existing vaults.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `createVault` function is designed to create a new LMP vault and add it to the `vaultRegistry`. However, it fails to include a vital check that ensures the new vault address doesn't already exist in the `vaultRegistry`. This omission can result in the accidental overwriting of existing vaults, causing unintended and potentially harmful consequences.
```solidity
function createVault(
    uint256 supplyLimit,
    uint256 walletLimit,
    string memory symbolSuffix,
    string memory descPrefix,
    bytes32 salt,
    bytes calldata extraParams
) external onlyVaultCreator returns (address newVaultAddress) {
    // ... (other code)

    // Clone the template vault to create a new vault
    newVaultAddress = template.cloneDeterministic(salt);

    // Initialize the new vault and set its rewarder
    LMPVault(newVaultAddress).initialize(supplyLimit, walletLimit, symbolSuffix, descPrefix, extraParams);
    LMPVault(newVaultAddress).setRewarder(address(mainRewarder));

    // Add the new vault address to the vaultRegistry
    vaultRegistry.addVault(newVaultAddress);
}

```
## Impact
The absence of a check for the existence of the `newVaultAddress` in the `vaultRegistry` means that the `createVault` function may inadvertently overwrite an existing vault with the same address. This could lead to loss of data, funds, and user balances associated with the overwritten vault. The impact could extend to users' trust in the system's reliability and the overall functionality of the liquidity mining protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, it's crucial to implement a check within the `createVault` function that verifies whether the `newVaultAddress` is already registered in the `vaultRegistry` before attempting to add it.
```solidity
// ... (other code)

function createVault(
    uint256 supplyLimit,
    uint256 walletLimit,
    string memory symbolSuffix,
    string memory descPrefix,
    bytes32 salt,
    bytes calldata extraParams
) external onlyVaultCreator returns (address newVaultAddress) {
    // ... (existing code)

    // Clone the template vault to create a new vault
    newVaultAddress = template.cloneDeterministic(salt);

    // Initialize the new vault and set its rewarder
    LMPVault newVault = LMPVault(newVaultAddress);
    newVault.initialize(supplyLimit, walletLimit, symbolSuffix, descPrefix, extraParams);
    newVault.setRewarder(address(mainRewarder));

    // Check if the newVaultAddress already exists in the vaultRegistry
    require(!vaultRegistry.isVaultRegistered(newVaultAddress), "Vault already exists");

    // Add the new vault address to the vaultRegistry
    vaultRegistry.addVault(newVaultAddress);
}
```
By incorporating this check, the function ensures that a vault with the same address doesn't already exist in the `vaultRegistry` before proceeding with the creation and addition of the new vault.
