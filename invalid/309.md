# When the reward rate changes, all the past rewards accrued will be treated with the current rate.
## Summary
When the reward rate changes, all the past rewards accrued will be treated with the current rate. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When updating your reward in any of the rewarder contracts, the `rewardPerToken();` function is called, which calculates the staking rewards based on `rewardRate`. 

```solidity
 return rewardPerTokenStored + ((lastBlockRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateBlock) * rewardRate * 1e18 / total);
```

When the `rewardRate` changes, all the past rewards not claimed will be treated with the current rate. Making losses for users that have unclaimed rewards if the rate goes lower
```solidity
    function setNewRewardRate(uint256 _newRewardRate) external hasRole(Roles.DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        newRewardRatio = _newRewardRate;
        emit NewRewardRateUpdated(_newRewardRate);
    }
```
## Impact
Users will get fewer rewards even though those were already accrued, losing previous unclaimed rewards

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Users should be able to redeem the rewards to the ratio they were accrued at.
