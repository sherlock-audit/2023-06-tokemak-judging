# Unit Errors for Tokens With Decimals Different Than 18
## Summary
the calculation of the reward does not work correctly for Tokens with decimals different than 18.

## Vulnerability Detail
The calculation of the reward does not work correctly for reward Tokens with decimals different than 18.

The `rewardPerTokenStored` and the returned value of `rewardPerToken()` should be in 18 decimals as well for the calculation in `earn()` to work correctly. In both calculations however, base is hardcoded instead of the actual base of the rewards. As a consequence, the calculation breaks for tokens not having 18 decimals.

## Impact

The results will be skewed when using tokens with different decimals, e.g., 6. The calculation would behave as if the user had much more tokens (because of the 1e18 division) than they actually do.

## Tool used

Manual Review + in-house tool

## Recommendation

Instead of hardcoding the value 1e18, use the actual base of the reward tokens.
