# User could receive 0 LMPVault shares after depositing asset
## Summary
User could get 0 shares in LMPVault.deposit because of rounding down in previewDeposit.

## Vulnerability Detail
In LMPVault.deposit, asset is specified and shares is calculated. It is possible for the calculated shares to be zero. If it is, assets would be taken from users, but no shares would be returned
```solidity
function previewDeposit(uint256 assets) public view virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
    shares = _convertToShares(assets, Math.Rounding.Down);
}

function deposit(
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver
) public virtual override nonReentrant noNavChange ensureNoNavOps returns (uint256 shares) {
    Errors.verifyNotZero(assets, "assets");
    if (assets > maxDeposit(receiver)) {
        revert ERC4626DepositExceedsMax(assets, maxDeposit(receiver));
    }

    shares = previewDeposit(assets);

    _transferAndMint(assets, shares, receiver);
}
```

## Impact
Users could lose assets for nothing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
require `shares!=0` like most implementations including [Solmate](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/3998897acb502fa7b480f505138a6ae1842e8d10/src/mixins/ERC4626.sol#L48)
