# Unable to withdraw/redeem shares if `perWalletLimit` decrease
## Summary

External protocols that integrate with Tokemak might break if the `perWalletLimit` decreases, potentially causing them to be unable to withdraw their shares.

## Vulnerability Detail

Based on the source code's comment below at Line 972, it stated the reason why it allows the `perWalletLimit` to decrease. It is reasonable to assume that the protocol team thinks it is safe to do so. 

However, it fails to consider other impacts or issues that can arise if the `perWalletLimit` is decreased.

```solidity
File: LMPVault.sol
969:     /// @notice Set the per-wallet share limit
970:     /// @param newWalletLimit new total shares a wallet is allowed to hold
971:     function _setPerWalletLimit(uint256 newWalletLimit) private {
972:         // Any decrease in this value shouldn't affect what a wallet is already holding
973:         // Just that their amount can't increase
974:         Errors.verifyNotZero(newWalletLimit, "newWalletLimit");
975: 
976:         perWalletLimit = newWalletLimit;
977: 
978:         emit PerWalletLimitSet(newWalletLimit);
979:     }
```

It will affect the withdrawal and redemption process of external protocols integrated with Tokemak's LMPVault, and potentially cause them to revert whenever they attempt to withdraw or redeem.

Assume that an external protocol called $Protocol_{xyz}$ owned 100 shares and configured its non-upgradable contracts to redeem all 100 shares when a specific condition is met. Assume that Tokemak decided to decrease the `perWalletLimit` from 200 shares to 50 shares after $Protocol_{xyz}$ obtains the 100 shares.

When the condition set by $Protocol_{xyz}$ is met, it will attempt to withdraw all the 100 shares from Tokemak's LMPVault. Internally within the LMPVault, it will burn all the 100 shares, and the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook will be executed.

The `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook is executed with the following parameter values:

- `from` parameter = to $Protocol_{xyz}$'s contract address
- `to` parameter = zero (because it is a burn action)
- `amount` parameter = 100 shares

However, since the `amount` is larger than `perWalletLimit` (100 shares > 50 shares), the condition at Line 849 below will be true and the transaction will revert. As a result, $Protocol_{xyz}$ cannot withdraw its shares. $Protocol_{xyz}$ also cannot break down the withdrawal of 100 shares to smaller chunks to workaround the new limit as its contracts are programmed to withdraw all the shares in one go and are non-upgradable similar to most contracts deployed on-chain.

841:         // from someone who is "staked" in the rewarder. Make sure they stop earning
842:         // When they transfer those funds
843:         if (from != address(0)) {
844:             rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
845:         }
846: 
847:         // Make sure the destination wallet total share balance doesn't go above the
848:         // current perWalletLimit
849:         if (balanceOf(to) + amount > perWalletLimit) {
850:             revert OverWalletLimit(to);
851:         }
852:     }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider updating the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook to ensure that the burning of shares is not subjected to unnecessary per-wallet share limit checks.

If `to` is zero, it means that the shares are burned. Thus, the per-wallet share limit checks can be safely ignored as the burn address (0x000) should not be subjected to the per-wallet share limit.

```diff
+ if (balanceOf(to) + amount > perWalletLimit && to != address(0)) {
- if (balanceOf(to) + amount > perWalletLimit) {
    revert OverWalletLimit(to);
}
```

By applying these changes, this issue will not occur even if the `perWalletLimit` is decreased.
