# Curve swapper cannot handle eth pools
## Summary

Curve swapper cannot handle eth pools

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract `CurveV1StableSwap.sol` contract handles swap using curve pools. But this contract isnt designed to send eth to the pools, and thus cannot convert eth to other tokens via curve v1 pools.

If tokemak decides to add stETH or some other derivative of eth, it will need to convert reward tokens into steth tokens. The largest eth-steth pool is the curve V1 pool with 330 milllion USD of liquidity. However this contract, due to it being V1, does not handle weth and does swaps based on native eth. So the contract will be unable to do swaps with this pool.

The test suite actually uses a V2 steth-eth pool, the one at 0x828b154032950C8ff7CF8085D841723Db2696056. This is a V2 pool using weth, which the contract can handle. However this pool only has 4 million USD of liquidity, and should thus be avoided in favour of the 100x more liquid V1 pool for better prices.

## Impact

Contract unable to do swaps with native eth pools, or V1 curve pools

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make the swapper functions payable and have it forward the `msg.value` in order to use curve V1 pools.
