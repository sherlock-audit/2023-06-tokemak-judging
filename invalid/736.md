# LMPVault withdrawal makes swaps without slippage protection
## Summary

On `LMPVault._withdraw` the shares are swapped to assets. This swap is done without a slippage protection.

## Vulnerability Detail

Assets are pulled from the vaults in LMPVault.withdraw:

```solidity
function _withdraw(
...
	for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawalQueueLength; ++i) {
    IDestinationVault destVault = IDestinationVault(withdrawalQueue[i]);
    (uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) = _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
    ...

    uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));
```

In withdrawBaseAsset, the swap is done with minBuyAmount 0

```solidity
function withdrawBaseAsset(uint256 shares, address to) external returns (uint256 amount) {
...
		ISwapRouter swapRouter = _systemRegistry.swapRouter();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < nTokens; ++i) {
        address token = tokens[i];

        if (token == _baseAsset) {
            amount += amounts[i];
        } else {
            if (amounts[i] > 0) {
                IERC20(token).safeApprove(address(swapRouter), amounts[i]);
// minBuyAmount is set to 0. There is no slippage protection
                amount += swapRouter.swapForQuote(token, amounts[i], _baseAsset, 0);
            }
        }
    }
```

This slippage protection therefore does not protect against sandwich attacks

```solidity
function swapForQuote(
        address assetToken,
        uint256 sellAmount,
        address quoteToken,
        uint256 minBuyAmount
    ) external onlyDestinationVault(msg.sender) nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
...
		uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(quoteToken).balanceOf(address(this));
		
		uint256 balanceDiff = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
		if (balanceDiff < minBuyAmount) revert MaxSlippageExceeded();
}
```

## Impact

Swaps can be sandwiched causing a loss of funds for the users who are withdrawing their funds

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function withdrawBaseAsset(uint256 shares, address to) external returns (uint256 amount) {
...
		ISwapRouter swapRouter = _systemRegistry.swapRouter();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < nTokens; ++i) {
...
                IERC20(token).safeApprove(address(swapRouter), amounts[i]);
// minBuyAmount is set to 0. There is no slippage protection
                amount += swapRouter.swapForQuote(token, amounts[i], _baseAsset, 0);
            }
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the `minAmountOut` parameter as some maximum deviation from the `sharesToBurn` asset value in `_withdraw` function.
