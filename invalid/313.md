# USER CAN MINT MORE TOKENS THAN IT SHOULD DUE TO WRONG POINTS CALCULATION.
## Summary
In the `GPToke.sol` contract in `previewPoints()` function points calculate based on duration from staking `end` timestamp,
but it is possible for user to mint more than it should.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a condition "`if (duration > maxStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooLong();`" in `previewPoints()` function, 
but it is still possible to calculate `end` value more than `maxStakeDuration`.

If `start` value is more than `startEpoch` it will be equal to `block.timestamp`. User can set `duration` equal to `maxStakeDuration - 1`, so `end` will be more than `maxStakeDuration`.

```solidity
    function previewPoints(uint256 amount, uint256 duration) public view returns (uint256 points, uint256 end) {
        if (duration < minStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooShort();
        if (duration > maxStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooLong();

        // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
        uint256 start = block.timestamp > startEpoch ? block.timestamp : startEpoch;
        end = start + duration;

        // calculate points based on duration from staking end date
        uint256 endYearpoc = ((end - startEpoch) * 1e18) / 365 days;
        uint256 multiplier = PRBMathUD60x18.pow(YEAR_BASE_BOOST, endYearpoc);

        points = (amount * multiplier) / 1e18;
    }
```
Due to `end` is more than `maxStakeDuration`, `endYearpoc` will be more than is should be and it will affect the `multiplier` parameter, as a result `points`  will be the bigger value that it sould be. 

So user will mint more tokens than it should be as `points` uses in in `stake()` function.

## Impact
User can mint more tokens that it should.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add revert condition if `duration` is more than `maxStakeDuration`.

```solidity
    function previewPoints(uint256 amount, uint256 duration) public view returns (uint256 points, uint256 end) {
        if (duration < minStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooShort();
        if (duration > maxStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooLong();

        // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
        uint256 start = block.timestamp > startEpoch ? block.timestamp : startEpoch;
        end = start + duration; 
    ++++if (end > maxStakeDuration) revert StakingDurationTooLong();
        // calculate points based on duration from staking end date
        uint256 endYearpoc = ((end - startEpoch) * 1e18) / 365 days;
        uint256 multiplier = PRBMathUD60x18.pow(YEAR_BASE_BOOST, endYearpoc);

        points = (amount * multiplier) / 1e18;
    }
```
