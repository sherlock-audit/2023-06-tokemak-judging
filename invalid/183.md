# duration could be set to the Maximum value by different admins
## Summary
in various places throughout the contract, the duration for could be set to the maximum values by admins
## Vulnerability Detail
the duration for reward periods in blocks and lock duration  can all be set by different admins. they can decide that these durations should take up the maximum values which is type(uint256).max which in turn would deny stakers rewards and lock up their staking positions forever.
## Impact
stakers will never receive rewards and their tokens could be locked up forever.
