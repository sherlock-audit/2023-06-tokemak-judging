# Missing deadline checks allow pending transactions to be maliciously executed
## Summary

The [**`BaseAsyncSwapper`**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/BaseAsyncSwapper.sol) contract does not allow the sender to submit a deadline for their action. This missing feature enables pending transactions to be maliciously executed at a later point.

## Vulnerability Detail

Swap functions should provide the sender with an option to limit the execution of their pending actions, such as swaps or adding and removing liquidity. The most common solution is to include a deadline timestamp as a parameter (for example see [Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L229)). If such an option is not present, users can unknowingly perform bad trades.

## Impact

The [**`BaseAsyncSwapper`**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/BaseAsyncSwapper.sol) contract allows pending transactions to be maliciously executed at a later point.

## Recommendation

Introduce a **`deadline`** parameter to the [**`swap()`**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/BaseAsyncSwapper.sol#L19) function.
