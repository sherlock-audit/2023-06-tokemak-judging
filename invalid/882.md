# The maverick destination vault is missing a payable receive
## Summary
The maverick destination vault is missing a payable receive

## Vulnerability Detail

Curve stETH/ETH concentrated: 

0x828b154032950C8ff7CF8085D841723Db2696056

when a ERC20 token paired with native token ETH
and when user remove liquidity, the ERC20 token is received and the ETH is received as well

to receive ETH the smart contract needs to implement the receive payable fallback function

for example when remove liquidity from the curve pool, the extra care is taken in the current implementation

this is done correctly for the curve pool this is the call flow CurveV2FactoryAdapter.sol#removeLiquidity -> _runWithdrawal -> pool.remove_liquidity

```solidity
function _runWithdrawal(address poolAddress, uint256[] memory amounts, uint256 maxLpBurnAmount) private {
        uint256 nTokens = amounts.length;
        ICryptoSwapPool pool = ICryptoSwapPool(poolAddress);
        if (nTokens == 2) {
            uint256[2] memory staticParamArray = [amounts[0], amounts[1]];
            pool.remove_liquidity(maxLpBurnAmount, staticParamArray);
        } else if (nTokens == 3) {
            uint256[3] memory staticParamArray = [amounts[0], amounts[1], amounts[2]];
            pool.remove_liquidity(maxLpBurnAmount, staticParamArray);
        } else if (nTokens == 4) {
            uint256[4] memory staticParamArray = [amounts[0], amounts[1], amounts[2], amounts[3]];
            pool.remove_liquidity(maxLpBurnAmount, staticParamArray);
        }
    }
```

so in this case, the receiver which is the destination vault will receive ERC20 token and ETH and the CurveConvexVault is prepared to receive the ETH

the default payable is implemented in this [line of code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak-JEFFCX/blob/3abd6ab9d2ba8626b92143a28bae22e009dd0501/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/CurveConvexDestinationVault.sol#L80) 

however when integrated with the mevarick protocol

the in-scope liquidity pool is Maverick ETH/swETH boosted: 0xF917FE742C530Bd66BcEbf64B42c777B13aac92c
the liquidity is withdrawable from the boostedPool

```solidity
 (uint256 sellAmountA, uint256 sellAmountB) =
            maverickBoostedPosition.burnFromToAddressAsReserves(address(this), address(this), underlyerAmount);

```
but the mevarick destination vault is missing the default receive payable
which means, user cannot really withdraw ETH / SWETH from the maverick boasted pool

## Impact
usrs cannot withdraw ETH/SWETH from the maverick boosted pool

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add payable receive in order to be able to receive native eth in the vault.
