# [M-02] Use of deprecated method could revert for some tokens
## Summary

The `safeApprove` method is used on several occasions which is a deprecated method and is discouraged to be used. It can lead to unexpected reverts when interacting with specific tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are tokens that revert on non-zero to non-zero approvals and need to and need to be approved to 0 first. Such tokens are `CRV`, `CVX`, and `LDO` which are all expected to be used within the project as can be seen from the docs and the contracts. This means that if the `allowance` is not fully used, the `safeApprove` will fail. Moreover, the `safeApprove` method is removed from the latest version (4.9.0) of [SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) which should be used as the OpenZeppelin team constantly updates their libraries to ensure bug-free and optimized contracts.

## Impact

Functions like `mint` and `withdrawBaseAsset` can revert if the `allowance` is not 0.
