# LMPVault.redeem function lacks a check to ensure the amount of assets being redeemed is not less than the expected amount
## Summary

`LMPVault.redeem` function lacks a check to ensure the amount of assets being redeemed is not less than the expected amount, leading to potential non-compliance with the ERC4626 standard.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LMPVault.redeem` function fails to incorporate a validation check to ensure that the amount of assets being redeemed (`assets`) is not less than the value returned (`possibleAssets`) by the `previewRedeem(shares)` function in the same transaction. 
This vulnerability results in a deviation from the ERC4626 standard requirement, which stated "MUST return as close to and no more than the exact amount of assets that would be withdrawn in a `redeem` call in the same transaction. I.e. `redeem` should return the same or more `assets` as `previewRedeem` if called in the same transaction."
This vulnerability can be exploited in scenarios where the LMPVault withdraws assets from one of the destination vaults during user redemptions, and that specific destination vault is at a loss. In such cases, users would receive assets proportionate to the losses, which would lead to `assets` being less than `possibleAssets`.

(Reference: [EIP-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626))
## Impact

The absence of the proper validation check in the `redeem()` function can result in the contract not complying with the ERC4626 standard's requirement. Users/protocols relying on the `previewRedeem()` function to estimate the expected asset amount might encounter unexpected asset losses (unexpectedly unfavourable redemption rates) since the vault's behaviour  for `redeem()` function can deviate from what users/protocols anticipate based on the standard.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to modify the `redeem()` function to include a validation check that ensures the `assets` being redeemed are not less than `possibleAssets`.
