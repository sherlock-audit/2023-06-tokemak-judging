# User can lose Extra Rewards
## Summary
Users can end up losing their extra rewards

## Vulnerability Detail
Main Rewarder adds extra reward token using addExtraReward
User A makes a deposit of amount 1000 using stake function
This stakes extra rewards A,B for this user
Main Rewarder now calls clearExtraRewards which removes extraRewards object
User A has now no way to retrieve the staked extra rewards A,B of amount 1000

## Impact
The Main Rewarder contract can at anytime delete the extra Rewards. This impacts the extra rewards earned by existing staker. The existing staker will have no way to claim these extra rewards. Since these extra rewards have been designated for all users making a deposit so basically the extra reward gets cleared with no one having access to this fund.

## Tool used
Manual Review + H2O

## Recommendation
Add a Check to see  if extra rewards have been claimed before executing. If the Main Rewarder wants to clear extra rewards then all existing stakes on extra rewards must be withdrawn and claimed so that user extra rewards are not lost.
