# Once shutdown function is called there is no way to return the boolean to false
##Summary
The shutdown feature does not have a way to set the it to false, there is only an option of setting it to true.

##Vulnerability details
The shutdown feature does not have a way to set the it to false, there is only an option of setting it to true, so once it is called it cannot reverted 

## Impact
Once the feature is called maybe by mistake or intentionally  there is no way to revert it which leaves some key features in the contract locked and if users decide to check if shutdown mode is active it could cause confusion
## Code Snippet
 function shutdown() external onlyOwner {
        _shutdown = true;

        emit Shutdown();
    }

function isShutdown() external view returns (bool) {
        return _shutdown;
    }
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a function that can set shutdown to false
