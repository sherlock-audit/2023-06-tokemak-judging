# Reentrancy causing Deposit Inconsistency in `LMPVaultRouterBase`'s `deposit` Function
## Summary
The vulnerability in `LMPVaultRouterBase` contract `deposit` function, allows an attacker to maliciously manipulate the deposit process and potentially perform multiple mints of shares without depositing the intended assets.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `deposit` function in LMPVaultRouterBase allows users to deposit assets into an LMPVault and receive shares in return. The vulnerable code is as follows:
```solidity
function deposit(
    ILMPVault vault,
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 minSharesOut
) public payable virtual override returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
    // ...

    IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
    pullToken(vaultAsset, amount, address(this));

    sharesOut = _deposit(vault, to, amount, minSharesOut);

    // ...
}

```
A possible attack scenario would be as follows:

1. First, the function pulls the specified amount of assets into the contract using the `pullToken` function. The assets are pulled before the state changes are completed, creating a window of opportunity for an attacker.
2. Next, it calls the internal function `_deposit` to interact with the `LMPVault`. This function approves the `LMPVault` to spend the pulled assets and then calls the LMPVault's `deposit` function, which mints new shares for the caller.
3. During the LMPVault's `deposit` function execution, the attacker's contract receives the newly minted shares.
4. The attacker's contract can now execute its receive function, which may call back into the `LMPVaultRouterBase` contract, re-entering the deposit function while it is still being executed.
5. Since the assets have not been fully deposited yet (due to the initial deposit being incomplete), the attacker's contract can call the `deposit` function again. This potentially causes the deposit process to happen again, resulting in multiple mints of shares without the contract actually depositing the assets.
## Impact
The reentrancy vulnerability in the deposit function allows an attacker to repeatedly mint shares without actually depositing the intended assets into the LMPVault. This can lead to an exploitable situation, where the LMPVault's balance is out of sync with the number of shares in circulation, resulting in potential financial losses for other users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
contract LMPVaultRouterBase is ILMPVaultRouterBase, SelfPermit, Multicall, PeripheryPayments {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

    bool private locked; // Reentrancy guard

    function deposit(
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minSharesOut
    ) public payable virtual override returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
        require(!locked, "Reentrant call");

        locked = true;
        // ... (existing code) ...

        sharesOut = _deposit(vault, to, amount, minSharesOut);

        locked = false;
    }

    // ... (existing code) ...
}
```
By implementing the reentrancy guard, the contract will revert if another call to the `deposit` function is attempted while the function is still being executed. This prevents the reentrant attack and ensures that the state changes are completed before any external calls are made, effectively mitigating the reentrancy vulnerability.
