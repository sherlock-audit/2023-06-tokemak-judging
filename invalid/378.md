# Attempts to burn liquidity in BalancerAuraDestinationVault will revert if pool token order changes
## Summary
``BalancerAuraDestinationVault`` caches the pool tokens array of the Balancer vault it abstracts in ``initialize``, with no functionality allowing to change this array. However, pool token order is not guaranteed to remain the same, as mentioned in the documentation for internal functions used to retrieve pool tokens for Balancer vaults ([here](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/227683919a7031615c0bc7f144666cdf3883d212/pkg/vault/contracts/balances/GeneralPoolsBalance.sol#L171-L191), [here](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/227683919a7031615c0bc7f144666cdf3883d212/pkg/vault/contracts/balances/MinimalSwapInfoPoolsBalance.sol#L173C5-L195), and [here](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/227683919a7031615c0bc7f144666cdf3883d212/pkg/vault/contracts/balances/TwoTokenPoolsBalance.sol#L233-L262)). (For example, tokens could be registered/deregistered to change token addresses)

## Vulnerability Details
See above.

## Impact
Since ``poolTokens`` is used as input to remove liquidity from the Balancer pool in ``_burnUnderlyer`` and it is validated against the current pool tokens array returned by the corresponding vault, calls to ``withdrawUnderlying``  and ``withdrawBaseAsset`` (for LMPVault rebalancing and user withdrawals) will always revert as the token arrays won't match. Assuming this mismatch occurs after the vault has invested funds in the Balancer pool, this will prevent withdrawal of funds from the specific Balancer pool, locking the LMPVault's and user's funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using the returned value from the Balancer vault's ``getPoolTokens`` function when providing input for removing liquidity in ``BalancerAuraDestinationVault``.
