# Potential Flash Loan Attack in getPriceInEth Function
## Summary

There exist a potential flash loan attack vulnerability in the getPriceInETH function of the CurveOracle which could lead to significant Financial losses.

## Vulnerability Detaill

The getPriceInEth function retrieves the price in Ether of each underlying token of a given LP token, calculates the minimum price among them, and multiplies it by the virtual price of the pool to determine the price of the LP token in Ether. If the price of one or more underlying tokens is manipulated, this can cause the minimum price calculation to be distorted, leading to an incorrect price for the LP token. This can be exploited by attackers to make a profit at the expense of other users.


## Impact

This vulnerability could potentially allow attackers to manipulate the price of tokens in Curve LP pools which could result in significant financial losses for affected users.

##  Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make use of TWAP to determine the prices of the underlying assets in the pool.
