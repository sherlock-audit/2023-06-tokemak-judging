# LMPVault : `perWalletLimit` can be bypassed by using the different contract address of the same person.
## Summary

`LMPVault`  has restriction for each account.  For every account there is a cap on the number of shares that they can hold.

This can be easily bypassed by using the multiple account address of the same person.

## Vulnerability Detail

[perWalletLimit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L119C20-L119C34) is used in LMPVault to limit the number of shared that can be minted for a wallet. This limit is put to not allow the same wallet address to hold more shares.
The reason could be to avoid the depletion of share value when large amount of shares are dumped by a whale address.

This will be bypassed by using multiple wallet address by the same person.

## Impact

A single person can have multiple contract address and mint shared for them.
After that, they can transfer the shares to single wallet and do the price manipulation attack by dumping these shares.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a whitelist based concept. So that only the whitelisted address can interact with the vault.

or check the origin of the caller and flag them so that they can not use other contract address to interact with the vault.
