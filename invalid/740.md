# Missing Reentrancy checks in getPriceInEth function
## Summary

The getPriceInEth function in SwEthEthOracle   acks Reentrancy support check which is discrepancies to what it stated in the code that all Price Oracles are not view function to support Reentrancy checks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The getPriceInEth function in the SwEthEthOracle contract is marked as a view function, which means it should not modify the contract's state. However, the function does not have any reentrancy checks in place due to the use of "view"


## Impact

The missing reentrancy check in the getPriceInEth function could potentially lead to a read-only reentrancy attack
