# Minters can steal funds from Depositers
## Summary
Minters can steal tokens from depositors 

## Vulnerability Detail

The function deposit and the function mint both allow a user to mint shares through the function _transferandmint

 However the function deposit requires a user to deposit funds and the function mint does not. This creates the following dangerous scenario

1. Depositer calls the function deposit and receives shares in exchange for his assets 
2. Minters calls the function mint and receives shares without depositing assets 
3. Minter calls the function withdraw which gives the minter funds that belonged to the depositer

## Impact

Depositers can have their tokens stolen due to an unprotected mint function that allows a user to mint shares with no funds required
