# The quotes from Curve may be subject to manipulation
## Summary
The get_virtual_price() function in Curve has a reentrancy risk, which can affect the price if the protocol fetches quotes from pools integrated with ETH on Curve.


## Vulnerability Detail
The CurveOracle protocol calls the function get_virtual_price() to obtain a quote from Curve. However, all pools integrated with ETH pose a read-only reentrancy risk. Please refer below link for detail.

## Impact
The read-only reentrancy operation manipulates the price.

```solidity
function getVirtualPrice() internal view override returns (uint256 virtualPrice) {
        // NOTE: this contract is not intended to be used with ETH pools due to reentrancy issues
        return ICurveV1StableSwap(poolAddress).get_virtual_price();
    }
 ```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use TWAP to determine the prices of the underlying assets in the pool.
