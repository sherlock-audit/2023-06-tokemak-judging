# Potential duplicate registration of LP token in `register` function
## Summary
The `UniswapV2EthOracle` contract lacks a mechanism to prevent the registration of duplicate LP (liquidity pool) tokens. This omission allows the same LP token to be registered multiple times, potentially leading to inaccurate pricing calculations and confusion.
## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation of the `register` function in the `UniswapV2EthOracle` contract does not include a check to prevent the registration of duplicate LP tokens. Consequently, if the same `pairAddress` is used to register an LP token that has already been registered, the new `registration` data will overwrite the existing data in the registrations mapping.
</br>
Since the contract relies on accurate registration information to perform pricing calculations, the presence of duplicate registrations could lead to unintended behavior. For example, the duplicate registration may result in incorrect padding values and pricing calculations, impacting the accuracy of the price oracle's results.
## Impact
Duplicate registrations may lead to inconsistent and inaccurate pricing information for LP tokens. Users relying on the price oracle's data could make trading decisions based on incorrect pricing, potentially resulting in financial losses or misinformed actions.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to the function to ensure that duplicate LP tokens are not added.
