# Tokens Remain Stuck in Contract Post-Withdrawal
## Summary
After successfully withdrawing the tokens, there is no logic in place to transfer the withdrawn tokens to the users who initiated the withdrawal. As a result, users are not receiving the withdrawn tokens, leading to loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdrawStake` function in the contract handles the withdrawal of LP tokens from the Convex protocol. While the function interacts with the `IBaseRewardPool` to successfully withdraw and unwrap the LP tokens, it lacks the crucial step of transferring the withdrawn tokens to the user's address. The absence of this transfer step prevents users from receiving their withdrawn tokens, rendering the withdrawal process ineffective.
```solidity
function withdrawStake(address lpToken, address staking, uint256 amount) public {
    // Existing code for validations and interaction with Convex

    // Withdraw and unwrap LP tokens from Convex
    bool success = rewards.withdrawAndUnwrap(amount, false);
    if (!success) revert withdrawStakeFailed();

    // Remaining code for validations and calculations

    // Missing logic: Transfer withdrawn tokens to user
    // lpTokenErc.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
## Impact
Users who initiate withdrawals from the Convex protocol are not receiving the withdrawn Curve LP tokens. Consequently, users are losing the funds they intended to withdraw, leading to financial loss and dissatisfaction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure users receive their withdrawn tokens.
```solidity
function withdrawStake(address lpToken, address staking, uint256 amount) public {
    // Existing code for validations and interaction with Convex

    // Withdraw and unwrap LP tokens from Convex
    bool success = rewards.withdrawAndUnwrap(amount, false);
    if (!success) revert withdrawStakeFailed();

    // Remaining code for validations and calculations

    // Transfer withdrawn tokens to user using safeTransfer
    lpTokenErc.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
