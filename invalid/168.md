# Unreachable rewards due to rounding error
## Summary
Unreachable rewards due to rounding error
## Vulnerability Detail
`addWETHRewards` updates `accRewardPerShare` every time new rewards are deposited into `GPToke.sol`. When small enough amount of WETH is added as reward, solidity can potentially round `amount * REWARD_FACTOR / supply` down to 0. Especially `totalSupply` of this staking contract is designed to grow exponentially as time goes on, as well as increased amount of stakers (refer to `previewPoints()` to see how `point/shares` are calculated). Meaning as `totalSupply` increases, the threshold to avoid such error increases. This would create a scenario where some rewards are locked in this contract with no way for retrieval. 

## Impact
Stakers lose out on rewards

```solidity
function addWETHRewards(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(amount, "amount");

        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        Errors.verifyNotZero(supply, "supply");

        totalRewardsEarned += amount;
        accRewardPerShare += amount * REWARD_FACTOR / supply;

        emit RewardsAdded(amount);

        weth.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider revert when the amount rounds down to 0.

```solidity
function addWETHRewards(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(amount, "amount");

        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        Errors.verifyNotZero(supply, "supply");

        totalRewardsEarned += amount;
+       uint256 amountToAdd = amount * REWARD_FACTOR / supply;
+       if(amountToAdd == 0) revert();
-       accRewardPerShare += amount * REWARD_FACTOR / supply;
+       accRewardPerShare += amountToAdd;

        emit RewardsAdded(amount);

        weth.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```
