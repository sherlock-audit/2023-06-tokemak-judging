# [M-01] `DestinationVault` does not have a way to withdraw ETH
## Summary

The `CurveConvexDestinationVault` has a `receive` method but there is no way to withdraw ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `CurveConvexDestinationVault` is expected to support ETH operations as can be seen from the comment above the `receive` method:

```solidity
    ///@notice Support ETH operations
    receive() external payable { } 
```

However, the contract does not have any functions to work with the received ETH. Even if the contract is not expected to receive any ETH, there is no method to withdraw accidentally sent ETH.

## Impact

Any ETH sent to the contract will be stuck forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a method that can withdraw ETH from the `CurveConvexDestinationVault` contract or remove the `receive` method to ensure no ETH is sent to the contract.
