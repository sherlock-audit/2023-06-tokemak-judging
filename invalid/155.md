# Risk of Permanent Token Loss in `_claimRewards` If `sendTo` Is Set Incorrectly
## Summary
The contract's `_claimRewards` function includes a potential issue that could lead to unintentional lost of tokens if the `sendTo` address is set to the zero address (`address(0)`).
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_claimRewards` function is responsible for claiming rewards and transferring them to the specified `sendTo` address. However, the function includes a condition that checks whether the `sendTo` address is not the same as the contract's address (`address(this)`). This condition is intended to prevent accidental token burns by ensuring that the tokens are not sent to the contract itself. However, the check does not account for the zero address, which is a valid address but often used to denote token burning.
```solidity
if (sendTo != address(this) && amountsClaimed[i] > 0) {
    IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(sendTo, amountsClaimed[i]);
}
```
The code effectively allows the transfer to occur as long as the `sendTo` address is not the same as the contract's address, even if it is the zero address. As a result, if the `sendTo` address is unintentionally set to `address(0)`, the tokens claimed during the reward process will be transferred to the zero address and permanently removed from circulation.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that any tokens claimed as rewards through this function could be lost forever if the `sendTo` address is mistakenly set to the zero address. This could result in a reduction of the token's overall supply, potentially affecting the token's value and utility.
