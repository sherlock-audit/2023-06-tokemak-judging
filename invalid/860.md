# perWalletLimit should not be applied to address(0)
## Summary
perWalletLimit should not be applied to address(0)

## Vulnerability Detail

the the logic below there is no validation of the to address being the 0 address

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused {
        // Nothing to do really do here
        if (from == to) {
            return;
        }

        // If this isn't a mint of new tokens, then they are being transferred
        // from someone who is "staked" in the rewarder. Make sure they stop earning
        // When they transfer those funds
        if (from != address(0)) {
            rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
        }

        // Make sure the destination wallet total share balance doesn't go above the
        // current perWalletLimit
        if (balanceOf(to) + amount > perWalletLimit) {
            revert OverWalletLimit(to);
        }
    }
```
while this is usually not a problem, it is in this protocol because of this specific line of code
`if (balanceOf(to) + amount > perWalletLimit`

This is a problem because the 0 address is also the burn address. the burn address will definitely have a large amount of tokens and in the instance where it surpasses the perWalletLimit, users will be unable to transfer their tokens to the 0 address because the function will always revert. 

This in turn will always cause the `_burn` function to revert because this function sends tokens to the 0 address.

and the [_beforeTokenTransfer check](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/0a25c1940ca220686588c4af3ec526f725fe2582/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L288) is called

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/0a25c1940ca220686588c4af3ec526f725fe2582/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L288

```solidity
    function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        require(account != address(0), "ERC20: burn from the zero address");

        _beforeTokenTransfer(account, address(0), amount);

        uint256 accountBalance = _balances[account];
        require(accountBalance >= amount, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds balance");
        unchecked {
            _balances[account] = accountBalance - amount;
            // Overflow not possible: amount <= accountBalance <= totalSupply.
            _totalSupply -= amount;
        }

        emit Transfer(account, address(0), amount);

        _afterTokenTransfer(account, address(0), amount);
    }
```

Additionally users will not be able to use the `_withdraw` function because inside this function there is a call to `_burn` which will revert, so this entire function will revert.

```solidity
        _burn(owner, shares);

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, returnedAssets, shares);

        _baseAsset.safeTransfer(receiver, returnedAssets);

        return returnedAssets;
    }
```

## Impact
The protocol will be unable to burn tokens, and withdraw tokens. This is a complete DOS

## Recommendation
validate address 0 and ensure a per wallet limit is not applied to it as this will Dos the protocol
