# Convex stash tokens check calls non-existent `totalSupply` function leading to reverts
## Summary

Claiming Convex (and Aura) LP staking rewards fails if stash tokens are present in the extra rewards due to calling the non-existent `totalSupply` function, which causes Solidity to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

Claiming Convex (and Aura) LP staking rewards in the `ConvexRewardsAdapter._claimRewards` function claims optional extra rewards. Such extra rewards can include "stash" tokens. To determine the exact rewards received after claiming, all reward tokens' token balances are compared before and after the `getReward` call in line 89.

However, stash tokens do not have a `balanceOf` function (nor a `totalSupply` function) and thus require special treatment. For instance, the following contracts are considered stash tokens:

- https://etherscan.io/address/0x647596A225e27c5a3554D8f0e851Cb5fF759B7EF
- https://etherscan.io/address/0x4A53301Fe213ECA70f904cD3766C07DB3A621bF8

To determine if the current token is **not** a stash token, the `totalSupply` function is called in line 83. However, in the case of a stash token, the `totalSupply` function does not exist and thus causes Solidity to revert.

## Impact

Claiming Convex (and Aura) LP staking rewards fails in case stash tokens are present in the extra rewards.

## Code Snippet

[src/destinations/adapters/rewards/ConvexRewardsAdapter.sol#L83](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/rewards/ConvexRewardsAdapter.sol#L83)

Calling the `totalSupply` function on the stash token address reverts with an error as the function does not exist. Similarily, the [second stash token check in line 98](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/rewards/ConvexRewardsAdapter.sol#L98) fails as well.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using a low-level call such as `staticcall` to check for the presence of stash tokens. For example:

```solidity
(bool success,) = rewardTokens[i].staticcall(abi.encodeWithSignature("totalSupply()"));

if (success) {
    // stash token is present
}
```
