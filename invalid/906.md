# If any of users reward token on Maverick gets stale they lose out on all rewards earned before it got to the stale state

## Summary

Maverick's contract rewarder have a [`removeStaleToken()`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x14edfe68031bbf229a765919eb52ae6f6f3347d4#code) function, what this function does underneath is deleting the provided index of the token that's stale from the `tokenIndex` mapping

  <summary></summary>

```solidity
        // remove token from list
        globalActive.unset(rewardTokenIndex);
        delete tokenIndex[address(data.rewardToken)];
```

</details>

This essentially leads to a skip of that particular token when trying to claim rewards, due to `earnedInfo.earned == 0` being true.

## Vulnerability Detail

While claiming rewards related to Maverick the internal [`_claimRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/rewards/MaverickRewardsAdapter.sol#L38-L76) function from the `MaverickRewardsAdapter.sol` contract gets eventually called

```solidity
    function _claimRewards(address rewarder, address sendTo) internal returns (uint256[] memory, address[] memory) {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(rewarder, "rewarder");
        address account = address(this);

        IReward reward = IReward(rewarder);

        // Fetching the earned rewards information
        IReward.EarnedInfo[] memory earnedInfos = reward.earned(account);
        uint256 length = earnedInfos.length;

        address[] memory rewardTokens = new address[](length);
        uint256[] memory amountsClaimed = new uint256[](length);

        // Iterating over each reward info, if earned is not zero, reward is claimed
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            IReward.EarnedInfo memory earnedInfo = earnedInfos[i];
            IERC20 rewardToken = IERC20(earnedInfo.rewardToken);
            rewardTokens[i] = address(rewardToken);
            //@audit
            if (earnedInfo.earned == 0) {
                amountsClaimed[i] = 0;
                continue;
            }

            // Fetching the current balance before claiming the reward
            uint256 balanceBefore = rewardToken.balanceOf(sendTo);

            // Claiming the reward
            // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
            reward.getReward(sendTo, uint8(i));

            // Calculating the claimed amount by comparing the balance after claiming the reward
            amountsClaimed[i] = rewardToken.balanceOf(sendTo) - balanceBefore;
        }

        RewardAdapter.emitRewardsClaimed(rewardTokens, amountsClaimed);

        return (amountsClaimed, rewardTokens);
    }
```

As seen, if a user has staked a token for quite a while and Maverick assume it's now stale, it gets deleted from the tokenIndex's mapping then `earnedInfo.earned == 0` is essentially true which means that the amounts to be claimed gets set to 0 which causes the token to get unfairly skipped and user loses out on all the rewards they have accumulated.

## Impact

User loses out on rewards from tokens that get stale

Manual Audit

## Recommendation

Measures should be taken to account for maverick setting reward tokens stale.
Lastly this vector can be seen as one of the external integration issues requested by sponsors.
