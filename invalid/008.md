# First depositor can steal asset tokens of others
## Summary
The first depositor can be front run by an attacker and as a result, will lose a considerable
part of the assets provided.
When the pool has no share supply, in `_convertToAssets`, the amount of shares to be minted is
equal to the assets provided. An attacker can abuse of this situation and profit of the
rounding down operation when calculating the number of shares if the supply is non-zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
The code in OZ for shares is changed which is able to prevent first depositor issue

```solidity
    function _convertToAssets(uint256 shares, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 assets) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        assets = (supply == 0) ? shares : shares.mulDiv(totalAssets(), supply, rounding);
    }
```

```solidity
    function _convertToAssets(uint256 shares, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256) {
        return shares.mulDiv(totalAssets() + 1, totalSupply() + 10 ** _decimalsOffset(), rounding);
    }

## Recommendation
When totalSupply == 0, send the first min liquidity LP tokens to the zero address to enable share dilution or change to OZ implementation
