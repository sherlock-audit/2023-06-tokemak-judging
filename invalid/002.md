# Interactions with AMMs do not use deadlines for operations
## Summary
Interactions with AMMs do not use deadlines for operations
## Vulnerability Detail
No expiration deadline
## Impact
The deadline should not be set to block.timestamp because validators can hold transactions and the final included block will have the block.timestamp, so it doesn't provide any protection.
