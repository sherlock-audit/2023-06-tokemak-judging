# Whale might have all shares burnt and not receive all Base token.
## Summary
"Destination Vaults are vaults that sit in front of any place we may be deploying assets. These vaults act as a common interface to these various places allowing us to hide the intricacies of DeFi from the rest of the system. These vaults also hold any receipt tokens we receive from these deployments."

In ```LMPVault.redeem```, users interact to redeem BaseAsset as stated in the ```main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault)
/README.md``` "Users will deposit and withdraw the base asset from here."
In ```LMPVault.redeem``` When a user makes attempt to redeem shares, a call is made to _withdraw where shares are burnt before transfer is made to the user in  ```LMPVault._withdraw```.
```solidity
 _burn(owner, shares);

   emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, returnedAssets, shares);

    _baseAsset.safeTransfer(receiver, returnedAssets);
```

However, it is possible to burn user share without giving the user equivalent amount of BaseAsset due to an assumption that could fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
When ```LMPVault.redeem``` is called to make redeem, 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L428-L431

After the asset amount has been quarried based on shares, 
```uint256 possibleAssets = previewRedeem(shares);``` 

```_withdraw(possibleAssets, shares, receiver, owner);``` is then called to burn user shares and transfer equivalent amount.

In the code snippet below, an assumption that is costly was made, the assumption that https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L508-L509, is one that might not be true in certain situation(edge case, tho rare, but possible). In a scenario where a whale with a Major shares tries to reddem all shares, and the ```totalIdle``` is not enough to handle to payment, the function then loops through all destination vault to withdraw BaseAsset in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L470-L506

However, it is possible that a destination vault with the major BaseAsset is unable to transfer funds due to certain unexpected event, the function assumes that the expcted amount is complete wihout proper verification.
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L508-L509
It then goes on to burn the entire shares in ```  _burn(owner, shares);``` and transfers ``` _baseAsset.safeTransfer(receiver, returnedAssets);```

A Case Study
1. A whale deposites 95_000_000 to mint 95_000_000 worth of shatres
2. He tries to redeem shares by calling redeem, the asset amount was quarried to be 95_000_000 
3. The _withdrwal function was called
4. Idle asset was not enough to execute withdrwal
5. Destination vault was quarried, but unfortunately amount was still not complete
6. Function assumes amount is complete and burns 95_000_000 worth of shares from the user
7. Transfer of 90_000_000 was made, user losses 5_000_000

This happened because no check that ```  uint256 returnedAssets = info.assetsFromIdle + info.totalAssetsPulled;``` is equal to ```assets```, only as assumption(stated in the comment) was made. 

If the user calls the ``````LMPVault.withdraw``` method, this problem will not surface because the function has a validation check that the snet amount equal to the assets required by user, check the snippet bellow.
        shares = previewWithdraw(assets);


        uint256 actualAssets = _withdraw(assets, shares, receiver, owner);


        if (actualAssets < assets) {
            revert TooFewAssets(assets, actualAssets);
This check prevents sending a lower amount of asset to user than amount of shares that was burnt, but the check is missing in ```LMPVault.redeem``` 




## Impact
Whale might have all shares burnt and not receive all Base token, because the likelyhood of this might be low, I consider it a medium severity report.

## Tool used
Manual audit.


## Recommendation
Various ways to prevent this.
1. Have a validiation check in ```LMPVault.redeem``` to confirm that the amount of asset that was sent is equivalennt to the amount of shares burn just like in the withdraw function of the same contract. 
```solidity 
 if ( assets < possibleAssets ) {
            revert TooFewAssets(possibleAssets, assets);
        }
```
2. Have a validation check in the internal function _withdraw to assert that ```returnedAssets``` is equal to ```assets```
```solidity  
if ( assets < returnedAssets ) {
            revert TooFewAssets(returnedAssets, assets);
        }
```
