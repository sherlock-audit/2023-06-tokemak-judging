# GPToke Rewards Collection Can Lead to Massive Loss of User Funds
## Summary

The GPToke staking contract contains a critical bug in the `_collectRewards()` internal function that could lead to irrecoverable loss of user funds. If the reward transfer fails for any reason, a user's `unclaimedRewards` balance is reset before the transfer occurs, resulting in potentially unlimited rewards being lost. This poses a major risk to user funds and trust in the platform.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_collectRewards()` function first calculates any pending rewards due to the user, which includes:

-     Any new rewards accrued since last claim (`netRewardPerShare * balance`)
-     Any existing `unclaimedRewards` amount from previous cycles

It then proceeds to:

1\. Reset `unclaimedRewards` to 0

2\. Emit `RewardsClaimed` event

3\. Update `totalRewardClaimed` and per-user totals

4\. Finally, it calls `weth.safeTransfer()` to send the pending rewards to the user

The critical issue is that steps 1-3 above occur before the rewards are transferred. This means if the `weth.safeTransfer` call fails for any reason, the user's `unclaimedRewards` balance is wiped. This permanently destroys any record of those pending rewards.

For example:

1.     Alice has staked 10,000 TOKE for 1 year, accruing 100,000 WETH in `unclaimedRewards`
2.     Alice calls `collectRewards()`, which calculates 50 WETH in new pending rewards
3.     `_collectRewards()` resets Alice's `unclaimedRewards` to 0, losing the 100,000 WETH record
4.     The `weth.safeTransfer` call fails due to gas limits
5.     Alice has now permanently lost 100,000 WETH, worth over $100 million!

The contract meanwhile acts as if the rewards were successfully sent, creating a critical inconsistency in the platform's accounting.

This can occur any time the rewards transfer fails, due to:

-     Insufficient gas limits
-     External contract errors
-     Reentrancy/race conditions disrupting control flow
-     Temporary network issues

With no limit on unclaimed reward accrual over long durations, the potential loss amounts are essentially unlimited.

## Impact


-     Users could lose all unclaimed rewards accrued over long stake durations
-     With no limit on reward accrual, losses could easily amount to millions of dollars worth of funds
-     Loss of user confidence, reputation damage, litigation risk
-     Permanent inconsistency in platform accounting and rewards totals
-     Requires complex manual reconciliation and user reimbursement

```solidity
    function _collectRewards(address user, bool distribute) internal returns (uint256) {
        // calculate user's new rewards per share (current minus claimed)
        uint256 netRewardsPerShare = accRewardPerShare - rewardDebtPerShare[user];
        // calculate amount of actual rewards
        uint256 netRewards = (balanceOf(user) * netRewardsPerShare) / REWARD_FACTOR;
        // get reference to user's pending (sandboxed) rewards
        uint256 pendingRewards = unclaimedRewards[user];


        // update checkpoint to current
        rewardDebtPerShare[user] = accRewardPerShare;


        // if nothing to claim, bail
        if (netRewards == 0 && pendingRewards == 0) {
            return 0;
        }


        if (distribute) {
            //
            // if asked for actual distribution, transfer all earnings
            //


            // reset sandboxed rewards
            unclaimedRewards[user] = 0;


            // get total amount by adding new rewards and previously sandboxed
            uint256 totalClaiming = netRewards + pendingRewards;


            // update running totals
            totalRewardsClaimed += totalClaiming;
            rewardsClaimed[user] += totalClaiming;


            emit RewardsClaimed(user, totalClaiming);


            // send rewards to user
            weth.safeTransfer(user, totalClaiming);


            // return total amount claimed
            return totalClaiming;
        }


        if (netRewards > 0) {
            // Save (sandbox) to their account for later transfer
            unclaimedRewards[user] += netRewards;


            emit RewardsCollected(user, netRewards);
        }


        // nothing collected
        return 0;
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this, the `unclaimedRewards` reset and state changes should occur after the rewards transfer:

```solidity

function _collectRewards() internal {

// Calculate rewards

// Transfer first

weth.safeTransfer(user, amount)

// State changes on success

unclaimedRewards[user] = 0;

emit RewardsClaimed(...)

totalRewardsClaimed += amount;

}

```
