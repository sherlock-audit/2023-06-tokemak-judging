# H - Paused Withdrawals in LMPVaults are a rugpull risk
## Summary
The `Pausable` OZ contract allows for pausing critical contract functionality in dangerous moments, for example when the protocol finds a vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `maxWithdraw` from `LMPVault` is setting the maximum withdraw to 0 when the contract is paused, as we can see here:

```
maxAssets = paused() ? 0 : previewRedeem(balanceOf(owner));
```

What this means is that the address with pause privileges on the contract can block funds from being withdrawn whenever they want. This presents itself as a massive centralisation/rugpull risk vector. As an example, the `DestinationVault` contract does not prevent withdrawals from happening.

## Impact
Users should be worried that their deposit can actually be frozen in the vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the paused functionality from `maxWithdraw`.
