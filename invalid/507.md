# Access control
## Summary

Add proper access control: Need for Measure Access Management for this function

## Vulnerability Detail

It is crucial to implement stringent access control measures to prevent unauthorized user-defined contract addresses. Additionally, the check-effect-interaction pattern must be accurately executed. Non-compliance with these measures could potentially expose the system to malicious contracts, leading to exploitation of the harvest position, false reporting of claimed tokens, and unauthorized transfer of our claimed tokens before their return.

## Impact

Malicious attack based on user-defined input parameters

## Code Snippet

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            uint256 tokenId = nftPool.tokenOfOwnerByIndex(account, i);
            nftPool.harvestPosition(tokenId);
        }

        uint256 grailTokenBalanceAfter = grailToken.balanceOf(account);
        uint256 xGrailTokenBalanceAfter = xGrailToken.balanceOf(account);

        IERC20[] memory rewardTokens = new IERC20[](2);
        uint256[] memory amountsClaimed = new uint256[](2);

        rewardTokens[0] = grailToken;
        amountsClaimed[0] = grailTokenBalanceAfter - grailTokenBalanceBefore;
        rewardTokens[1] = xGrailToken;
        amountsClaimed[1] = xGrailTokenBalanceAfter - xGrailTokenBalanceBefore;

        emit RewardsClaimed(rewardTokens, amountsClaimed);

        return (amountsClaimed, rewardTokens);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is crucial to implement robust access control or contemplate the removal of the user-defined external contract address for this function. This recommendation is based on the potential vulnerability to manipulation through the nftPool.harvestPosition.
