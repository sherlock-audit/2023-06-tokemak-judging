# Incorrect price Calculations Due to Precision Loss in `SfrxEthEthOracle` contract
## Summary
The price calculation mechanism in the provided Solidity smart contract snippet has the potential for precision loss, which could result in inaccurate price calculations.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the code snippet, a price calculation is performed to determine the price of sfrxETH tokens in terms of Ether (ETH). Here is the relevant code:
```solidity
uint8 frxETHDecimals = frxETH.decimals();         // TODO: We're initializing decimals
frxETHPrecision = 10 ** frxETHDecimals;            // TODO: We're getting precision
price = (sfrxETH.pricePerShare() * frxETHPrice) / frxETHPrecision;
```
The calculation involves the following steps:
1. `frxETHDecimals` is retrieved to determine the number of decimal places in the `frxETH` token.
2. `frxETHPrecision` is calculated as 10 raised to the power of `frxETHDecimals`, which is used as a divisor to scale the price.
3. `price` is calculated by multiplying `sfrxETH.pricePerShare()` with `frxETHPrice` and then dividing by `frxETHPrecision`.
    However, due to potential decimal places in the multiplication result and the large value of `frxETHPrecision`, there is a risk of precision loss during the division. This loss of precision can lead to inaccurate price calculations, which is undesirable in financial applications.
## Impact
The precision loss can result in incorrect price calculations for sfrxETH tokens in terms of Ether (ETH). This can lead to erroneous financial decisions and calculations based on inaccurate prices, potentially causing financial losses or incorrect actions within the system.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the precision loss issue and ensure accurate price calculations, consider using fixed-point arithmetic libraries that are designed to handle decimal calculations more precisely. These libraries allow for accurate manipulation of decimal numbers while maintaining the necessary precision. By utilizing such libraries, you can ensure that the multiplication and division operations involved in the price calculation maintain their precision throughout the process. This will help prevent precision loss and guarantee accurate price calculations for financial transactions and decisions.
