# LMPVault.setPerformanceFeeBps should accrue fees
## Summary
LMPVault.setPerformanceFeeBps should accrue fees, otherwise fees will be lost.
## Vulnerability Detail
`LMPVault.setPerformanceFeeBps` function is used to change profit fee for the protocol.

```solidity
    function setPerformanceFeeBps(uint256 fee) external nonReentrant hasRole(Roles.LMP_FEE_SETTER_ROLE) {
        if (fee >= MAX_FEE_BPS) {
            revert InvalidFee(fee);
        }


        performanceFeeBps = fee;


        // Set the high mark when we change the fee so we aren't able to go farther back in
        // time than one debt reporting and claim fee's against past profits
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        if (supply > 0) {
            navPerShareHighMark = (totalAssets() * MAX_FEE_BPS) / supply;
        } else {
            // The default high mark is 1:1. We don't want to be able to take
            // fee's before the first debt reporting
            // Before a rebalance, everything will be in idle and we don't want to take
            // fee's on pure idle
            navPerShareHighMark = MAX_FEE_BPS;
        }


        emit PerformanceFeeSet(fee);
    }
```

As you can see in case if totalSupply is not 0, then this function doesn't accrue fee, that was generated before changing. As result those fee will be lost.

Accrue fees when change fee percentage.
