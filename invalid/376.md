# Invalid Access Control Modifiers
## Summary
Missing revert/ require statements in the onlyOwner modifier
## Vulnerability Detail
The LMPVault.sol Contract  which happens to be the core contract, inherits a broken modifier from SecurityBase.sol and this leaves functions in the Vault Contract vulnerable and also breaks the core functionality of the Tokemak ecosystem. 
## Impact
The Modifiers check for some functions are invalid and as such can be called by a malicious actor which can break the functionality of the protocol and lead to loss of funds amidst other issues
## Code Snippet
The onlyOwner modifier does not revert and can called be called by anyone.

The `verifyowner` function() that is called by the onlyOwner modifier, as you can see below has no logic to discern who the owner is

Affected Code:
Most of the functions in LMPVault.sol is hugely affected as it inherits from the SecurityBase.sol

## Tool used
Manual Review + H2O

## Recommendation
Update the onlyOwner modifier to have a require statement or revert statements
