# Uncontrolled Approval issue in the  removeLiquidity function
## Summary
The code approves the router contract to spend tokens without considering the necessary amount, allowing unauthorized spending, this can allow Malicious actors to  exploit and manipulate the contract's behavior and funds.
`router.position().approve(address(router), maverickExtraParams.tokenId);`  in this line  the token associated with tokenId, there's no consideration of the actual amount to approve. This means that the router contract can potentially spend any amount of tokens on behalf of your contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the vulnerable part of code : 
```solidity 
    function removeLiquidity(
        IRouter router,
        uint256[] calldata amounts,
        uint256 maxLpBurnAmount,
        bytes calldata extraParams
    ) external returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts) {
        //slither-disable-start reentrancy-events
        if (maxLpBurnAmount == 0) revert MustBeMoreThanZero();
        if (amounts.length != 2) revert ArraysLengthMismatch();
        if (amounts[0] == 0 && amounts[1] == 0) revert NoNonZeroAmountProvided();

        (MaverickWithdrawalExtraParams memory maverickExtraParams) =
            abi.decode(extraParams, (MaverickWithdrawalExtraParams));

        router.position().approve(address(router), maverickExtraParams.tokenId);

        (uint256 tokenAAmount, uint256 tokenBAmount, IPool.BinDelta[] memory binDeltas) =
            _runWithdrawal(router, amounts, maverickExtraParams);

        // Collect deployed bins data
        (
            uint256 binslpAmountSummary,
            uint256 binslpBalanceSummary,
            uint256 binsLpTotalSupplySummary,
            uint256[] memory deployedBinIds
        ) = _collectBinSummary(binDeltas, IPool(maverickExtraParams.poolAddress), maverickExtraParams.tokenId);

        if (binslpAmountSummary > maxLpBurnAmount) revert LpTokenAmountMismatch();
        if (tokenAAmount < amounts[0]) revert InvalidBalanceChange();
        if (tokenBAmount < amounts[1]) revert InvalidBalanceChange();

        actualAmounts = new uint256[](2);
        actualAmounts[0] = tokenAAmount;
        actualAmounts[1] = tokenBAmount;

        emit WithdrawLiquidity(
            [tokenAAmount, tokenBAmount],
            [
                address(IPool(maverickExtraParams.poolAddress).tokenA()),
                address(IPool(maverickExtraParams.poolAddress).tokenB())
            ],
            [binslpAmountSummary, binslpBalanceSummary, binsLpTotalSupplySummary],
            maverickExtraParams.poolAddress,
            maverickExtraParams.tokenId,
            deployedBinIds
        );
        //slither-disable-end reentrancy-events
    }

    /**
     * @notice Encodes the provided parameters into a byte array
     * @dev This function helps in building extraParams with dynamic values when using the Solver SDK
     * @param poolAddress The address of the pool
     * @param tokenId The ID of the token
     * @param deadline The deadline for the operation
     * @param maverickParams An array of AddLiquidityParams parameters
     * @return The encoded parameters as a byte array
     */
```
## Impact
By manipulating the tokenId and not specifying an appropriate amount, they can allow the router contract to spend an arbitrary number of tokens, potentially draining the contract's assets or causing other unintended consequences. This can lead to significant financial losses and compromise the integrity of the affected contract.

The Path how the assets can be drain with malicious :

- Craft a malicious incantation to call the "removeLiquidity" function.
Manipulate the "tokenId" parameter to point to the desired token.
- Abstain from specifying the amount of tokens to approve.
- Cast the spell, empowering the router contract with unchecked authorization.
- The router, now a puppet to sinister will, may spend tokens as it pleases, devouring the contract's assets.
The repercussions are dire, for this vulnerability can cascade into a cataclysmic event. The assets can be sucked into a maelstrom of malevolence, leaving devastation in their wake. The integrity of the contract would crumble, and the once-secure ecosystem would plunge into chaos.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- validate that the approved amount matches the expected amount. If they don't match, the approval process should be rejected.
