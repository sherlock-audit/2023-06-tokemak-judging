# `calculateFee()` will always return zero due to incorrect `feeBPS`
## Summary
calculateFee() will always return zero due to incorrect feeBPS 

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

**Issue 1:**
A basis point is a common unit of measure for interest rates and other percentages in finance. Basis points are typically expressed with the abbreviations bp, bps, or bips.

In `LiquidationRow.sol`, `feeBps` is set to 0 which is given below,

```Solidity
45    /// @notice Fee in basis points (bps). 1 bps is 0.01%
46    uint256 public feeBps = 0;
```

Now, check this Natspec at L-45, Per Natspec the `feeBps` must be 1 bps or 0.01%. With current implementation, the calculateFee() will always return 0

```Solidity

    function calculateFee(uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
>>        return (amount * feeBps) / MAX_PCT;
    }
```

Since the `feeBPS` is hardcoded to 0 therefore the `calculateFee()` will always return 0.

**Issue 2:**
In _performLiquidation(), 

```Solidity

    function _performLiquidation(
        uint256 gasBefore,
        address fromToken,
        address asyncSwapper,
        IDestinationVault[] memory vaultsToLiquidate,
        SwapParams memory params,
        uint256 totalBalanceToLiquidate,
        uint256[] memory vaultsBalances
    ) private {


      // some code


        // if the fee feature is turned on, send the fee to the fee receiver
>>      if (feeReceiver != address(0) && feeBps > 0) {


      // some code

    }
```
To perform the if condition it needs `feeBps > 0` which is not possible with current implementation as `feeBPS = 0`. This function wont work as expected which is an undesired behaviour. 

**Issue 3:**
feeBPS can be set to 0 Therefore the discussed condition in `Issue 2` can not be prevented. 

```Solidity

    function setFeeAndReceiver(address _feeReceiver, uint256 _feeBps) external hasRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE) {
        // feeBps should be less than or equal to MAX_PCT (100%) to prevent overflows
        if (_feeBps > MAX_PCT) revert FeeTooHigh();

        feeBps = _feeBps;
        // slither-disable-next-line missing-zero-check
        feeReceiver = _feeReceiver;
    }
```

A input validation is required to prevent this issue.

To learn further on BPS, checkout this [link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp). Below is the table showing BPS in percentage. `MAX_PCT = 10_000` is correctly set to `100%`, however `feeBps` must be set to `1 BPS` per Natspec, see recommendations too.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The issues can be fixed with below recommendations,

```diff

    /// @notice Fee in basis points (bps). 1 bps is 0.01%
-    uint256 public feeBps = 0;
+    uint256 public feeBps = 1;


     // some code


    function setFeeAndReceiver(address _feeReceiver, uint256 _feeBps) external hasRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE) {
+      require(_feeBps != 0, "feeBPS can not be zero");
+      require(_feeReceiver != address(0), "feeReceiver can not be zero address");
        // feeBps should be less than or equal to MAX_PCT (100%) to prevent overflows
        if (_feeBps > MAX_PCT) revert FeeTooHigh();

        feeBps = _feeBps;
        // slither-disable-next-line missing-zero-check
        feeReceiver = _feeReceiver;
    }

    function calculateFee(uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
+     require(amount != 0, "amount should be greater than zero");
        return (amount * feeBps) / MAX_PCT;
    }
```
