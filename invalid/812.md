# ERC4626 does not work with pay-on-transfer tokens
## Summary

The ERC4626.deposit/mint functions do not work well with fee-on-transfer tokens as the amount variable is the pre-fee amount, including the fee, whereas the totalAssets do not include the fee anymore.

The deposit() and mint() functions call the _transferAndMint() function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L604-L621
function _transferAndMint(uint256 assets, uint256 shares, address receiver) internal virtual {
     _baseAsset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
     totalIdle += assets;
     _mint(receiver, shares);
     emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
}

The _transferAndMint() function does not take into account that there are tokens with a transfer fee. For example, https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer.

It turns out that the user transfers _baseAsset in the amount of assets, but tokens are received in the account in the amount of: assets - commission for the transfer. This can be abused to mint more shares than desired.

## Vulnerability Detail

A deposit(1000) should result in the same shares as two deposits of deposit(500) but it does not because the amount is the pre-fee amount.
Assume a fee-on-transfer of 20%. Assume current totalAmount = 1000, totalShares = 1000 for simplicity.

deposit(1000) = 1000 / totalAmount * totalShares = 1000 shares
deposit(500) = 500 / totalAmount * totalShares = 500 shares. Now the totalShares increased by 500 but the totalAssets only increased by (100% - 20%) * 500 = 400. Therefore, the second deposit(500) = 500 / (totalAmount + 400) * (newTotalShares) = 500 / (1400) * 1500 = 535.714285714 shares.
In total, the two deposits lead to 35 more shares than a single deposit of the sum of the deposits.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

amount must be the amount before consideration, i.e. the amount actually received under the contract.
This can be done by subtracting the pre-contract balance from the post-contract balance.
