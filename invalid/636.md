# The decimalPad will remain the same even if token decimals changes while the ratio calculation will be incorrect.
## Summary
 An outdated decimalPad variable can lead to calculation errors and bugs,
## Vulnerability Detail
The decimalPad variable is set once at deployment based on the decimals of the token. For example, if the token has 18 decimals, decimalPad would be 10^18.
This decimalPad is then used in the ratio calculation [Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/beacon/FrxBeaconChainBacking.sol#L49)
The issue is that if the token decimal ever changes after deployment, the decimalPad will remain the old value but the ratio calculation will be incorrect.
For example, if the token originally had 18 decimals, decimalPad is 10^18. If the token decimal later changes to 6, the ratio calculation will still use decimalPad=10^18, even though it should be 10^6. This will make the ratio off by a factor of 10^12.
So in summary:
• decimalPad set once at deployment based on original token decimals
• Used in ratio calculation to scale assets/liabilities to token units
• If token decimals change later, ratio calculation will be off

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
A. Don't make decimalPad immutable, allow it to be changed
B. Update decimalPad whenever the token decimals change
C. Require the token decimals to be immutable once set
D. Perform the decimal conversion dynamically based on current decimals
