# Permanent Loss of Ether in LMPVaultRouterBase Contract in `_processEthIn` Function
## Summary
The `LMPVaultRouterBase` contract contains a critical issue that can lead to locking Ether sent to the contract forever. The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of the `_processEthIn` function when receiving ETH. If a user mistakenly sends ETH to the contract but passes an ERC20 token address as the `vault` parameter in the `mint` or `deposit` functions, the Ether will be locked in the contract indefinitely, and there is no mechanism to retrieve it.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_processEthIn` function in the `LMPVaultRouterBase` contract is intended to handle incoming Ether payments and automatically wrap them into Wrapped Ether (WETH) if the `vault` contract's asset is WETH. The function checks if any ETH `(msg.value > 0)` was sent during its execution and if the `vault.asset()` is `WETH`. However, if the `vault` parameter is mistakenly set to an invalid WETH address (e.g., an ERC20 token address), the function will revert, but the Ether sent by the user will remain locked in the contract.
```solidity
function _processEthIn(ILMPVault vault) internal {
    // if any eth sent, wrap it first
    if (msg.value > 0) {
        // if asset is not weth, revert
        if (address(vault.asset()) != address(weth9)) {
            Address.sendValue(payable(msg.sender), msg.value);
            revert InvalidAsset();
        }

        // wrap eth
        weth9.deposit{ value: msg.value }();
    }
}
```
For example, if the user mistakenly calls the `mint` function like this:
```solidity
// Incorrect usage: Passing an ERC20 token address instead of the correct vault address
mint(incorrectVaultAddress, recipient, 1 ether, 100);
```
The `_processEthIn` function will execute, check if `msg.value > 0`, which is true since 1 ether was sent. It will then proceed to check if the `vault.asset()` is `WETH`. However, since `incorrectVaultAddress` is not a valid WETH contract address, the check fails, and the function reverts with an `InvalidAsset` error. But the Ether sent by the user will already be locked in the contract, and there is no mechanism in the contract to retrieve it.
## Impact
The vulnerability can result in unintentional and permanent loss of Ether for users of the `LMPVaultRouterBase` contract. If a user mistakenly sends ETH to the contract while providing an incorrect `vault` address, the `_processEthIn` function will revert, and the user will receive a refund of the sent Ether. However, due to the reversion, the Ether will not be wrapped into WETH as intended, and the contract will not be able to carry out the desired operation. Consequently, the user's Ether will remain locked in the contract balance and will not be recoverable, leading to a permanent loss of funds for the affected user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, you should add a check to ensure that the `vault` parameter is a valid WETH contract address before attempting to wrap the Ether into WETH. If it is not a valid WETH address, the contract should revert and refund the Ether to the sender. Here's an updated version of the `_processEthIn` function with the necessary check:
```solidity
function _processEthIn(ILMPVault vault) internal {
    // if any eth sent, wrap it first
    if (msg.value > 0) {
        // Check if asset is WETH, otherwise revert and refund the Ether
        if (address(vault.asset()) != address(weth9)) {
            Address.sendValue(payable(msg.sender), msg.value);
            revert InvalidAsset();
        }

        // wrap eth
        weth9.deposit{ value: msg.value }();
    }
}
```
With this modification, if the `vault` parameter is not a valid WETH contract address, the function will revert and refund the Ether back to the sender, avoiding the issue of locking Ether in the contract forever.
