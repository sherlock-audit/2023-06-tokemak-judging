# virtual price from Curve can be exploited to manipulate price returns
## Summary
 The virtual price returned by Curve's get_virtual_price() is not validated in the getPriceInEth() function. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the price returned by this oracle
## Vulnerability Detail
The minPrice is calculated by getting the minimum price of the underlying tokens from the root price oracle. This is then multiplied by the virtual price returned by Curve's get_virtual_price().
An attacker who controls the Curve pool could make get_virtual_price() return an arbitrarily high number. This would cause the final price returned by getPriceInEth() to also be arbitrarily high.
For example, if minPrice is 100 and the attacker makes get_virtual_price() return 1000e18, the final price will be 100 * 1000e18 / 1e18 = 100,000.
## Impact
This could allow the attacker to manipulate the perceived price of the token to be much higher than the real price. Any contracts relying on this oracle for pricing could make decisions based on the manipulated price.
