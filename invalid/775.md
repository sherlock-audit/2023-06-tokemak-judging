# No way to distribute rewards which are not liquidatable into baseAsset
## Summary
If any of the reward tokens provided by destinations cannot be liquidated to baseAsset because there is no available on-chain liquidity pool for reward-token-to-baseAsset swapping, these rewards will be remained in the LiquidationRow contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some of the desination like curve has a way to add extra rewards and if any of those reward tokens is not liquidatable to baseAsset because there isn't any on-chain liquidity pool to swap them to baseAsset those rewards will be left in LiquidationRow contract.

So there should be a function on `LiquidationRow` contract  to add those kind of tokens as extra rewards to the desination vault.

## Impact
1. Non-liquidatable rewards will be locked in the liquidationRow contract.
2. There will be no way to distribute these kinda rewards to users who should receive them.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a function on `LiquidationRow` contract to add non-liquidatable reward tokens as extra rewards to the destination vault.
