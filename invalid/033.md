# Fees are not accrued every vault action which makes losses for protocol and users
## Summary
Fees are not accrued every vault action which makes losses for protocol and users. This is because protocol accrues fees only after rebalancing or debt updating. This allows users to avoid paying fees, while some depositors will be charged with a fee, when they should not be.
## Vulnerability Detail
`LMPValut._collectFees` function is called to calculate current exchange rate and mint fee tokens to protocol. Currently this function is called only on [rebalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L703), [flashRebalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L727) or [update debt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L797).

```solidity
    function _collectFees(uint256 idle, uint256 debt, uint256 totalSupply) internal {
        address sink = feeSink;
        uint256 fees = 0;
        uint256 shares = 0;
        uint256 profit = 0;


        // If there's no supply then there should be no assets and so nothing
        // to actually take fees on
        if (totalSupply == 0) {
            return;
        }


        uint256 currentNavPerShare = ((idle + debt) * MAX_FEE_BPS) / totalSupply;
        uint256 effectiveNavPerShareHighMark = navPerShareHighMark;


        if (currentNavPerShare > effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) {
            // Even if we aren't going to take the fee (haven't set a sink)
            // We still want to calculate so we can emit for off-chain analysis
            profit = (currentNavPerShare - effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) * totalSupply;
            fees = profit.mulDiv(performanceFeeBps, (MAX_FEE_BPS ** 2), Math.Rounding.Up);
            if (fees > 0 && sink != address(0)) {
                // Calculated separate from other mints as normal share mint is round down
                shares = _convertToShares(fees, Math.Rounding.Up);
                _mint(sink, shares);
                emit Deposit(address(this), sink, fees, shares);
            }
            // Set our new high water mark, the last nav/share height we took fees
            navPerShareHighMark = currentNavPerShare;
            navPerShareHighMarkTimestamp = block.timestamp;
            emit NewNavHighWatermark(currentNavPerShare, block.timestamp);
        }
        emit FeeCollected(fees, sink, shares, profit, idle, debt);
    }
```

In order to calculate current exhange rate function uses ` idle + debt` and `totalSupply`. And in case if current exchange rate is bigger than previous recorder, that means that vault generated profit. In this case `performanceFeeBps` percentage of profit is taken by protocol to mint shares. After that move, totalSupply has increased and actually user's amount has decreased(if you could get X for your shares, now you can get X-Y), because exchange rate has decreased as well.

Given that fees are accrued only on specific actions, which likely will be executed rarely, this allows users to avoid paying them, by withdrawing their shares right before `_collectFees` is called. And then deposit again and get more shares than before(as rate has decreased).

Another problem is that someone can deposit right before `_collectFees` is called. He didn't participate in yield generation, but he is charged as well(he gives some amount to mint shares to protocol as fee).
## Impact
Protocol can have losses if users will avoid paying fees.

## Recommendation
You need to accrue fees every deposit/withdraw in order to record fair exchange rate.
