# LiquidatonRow expects zero slippage which may prevent the automated liquidation from working in some cases
## Summary
In moments of even medium volatility , the liquidation routine may not work at all, preventing adding new rewards to rewarders.

`LiquidationRow` liquidates vaults for tokens which are laters used for rewards. The contract is meant to run automatically in order to periodically liquidate vaults for requested tokens. In `BaseAsyncSwapper`, `swap()` puts the automated logic at risk, as in normal market condition it may be often failing. This could destabilise the whole system by decreasing the frequency of queueing new rewards or even allow malicious parties to sabotage the automated logic.


## Vulnerability Detail

`LiquidationRow` swaps tokens during a liquidation in [Line 251](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L251) for each liquidated vault provided.

The swap is performed by an async swapper, for example as in [BaseAsyncSwapper.sol#L19 ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/BaseAsyncSwapper.sol#L19)
After the swap is done, the code in [BaseAsyncSwapper.sol#L51](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/BaseAsyncSwapper.sol#L51) checks if no less tokens than expected were received.

The parameters for the swaps are given in the struct [swapParams](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/interfaces/liquidation/IAsyncSwapper.sol#L5)

The script is meant to run in an automated way which means, the expected amount of minimum tokens to receive should be known upfront and passed as parameter to this function. Even if price of the tokens if known before the call by querying an oracle, and passed to an argument, if should not be expected that the price will be exactly the same, while the contract requires to receive not even one wei less than the assumed price.

Slippage may be triggered in moments of normal volatility.
Since the function is run automatically, there is no logic which prevents such issue.
If it were an user doing a swap, he might actually set some level of slippage consciously. But since it's automated, it is not known if the slippage will be counted in.

## Impact
In moments of even medium volatility , the liquidation routine may not work at all, preventing adding new rewards to rewarders.


## Code Snippet

```solidity
        uint256 buyTokenBalanceAfter = buyToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        buyTokenAmountReceived = buyTokenBalanceAfter - buyTokenBalanceBefore;

        if (buyTokenAmountReceived < swapParams.buyAmount) {//@audit easy to trigger revert here
            revert InsufficientBuyAmountReceived(buyTokenAmountReceived, swapParams.buyAmount);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The automated cloud routine is not known, it was assumed that it will use `buyAmount` of some certain price. In current situation either:
- to make `buyAmount` more secure, the automated cloud script takes a current price for each token e.g. from an oracle, and sets a `buyAmount` as a 95% of that price, thereby automatically allowing some level of slippage. ,
- or remove the strict check and use e.g. if `buyTokenAmountReceived` is at least 95% (or any slippage considered comfortable) of `swapParams.buyAmount`.
