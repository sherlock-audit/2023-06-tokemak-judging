# LMPVault.sol is not EIP-4626 compliant
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
There are multiple locations in the LMPVault that do not conform to [ERC-4626 specifications](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626):
1. previewWithdraw() does not include withdrawal fees
2. withdraw() must emit the Withdraw event
3. mint and deposit methods must emit Deposit event

## Impact
From the contest details we know that LMPVault.sol should be 4626 compatible.
Other protocols that integrate with Tokemak may wrongly assume that the functions are EIP-4626 compliant. Thus, it might cause integration problems in the future that can lead to wide range of issues for both parties.

## Recommendation
Consider correcting the above issues to meet the ERC-4626 specifications, allowing future vault developers to expect certain protocol behaviors.
