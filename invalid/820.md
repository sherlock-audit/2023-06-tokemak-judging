# `DestinationVault.sol` template is uninitialized, can be used to add tracked tokens and mess with other storage variables
## Summary

`DestinationVault.sol` template is uninitialized, can be used to add tracked tokens and mess with other storage variables

## Vulnerability Detail

The `DestinationVault.sol` contract is an abstract contract inherited by the destination vaults. The destination vaults themselves are deployed as clones from the `DestinationVaultFactory.sol` contract as shown below.

```solidity
vault = template.cloneDeterministic(salt);

IDestinationVault(vault).initialize(...);
```

Clones also clone the storage of the template contract. Thus if a user messes with the storage variables in the template contract, they also get reflected in the cloned contracts. The `DestinationVault.sol` contract has a `trackedTokens` mapping that is used to track relevant tokens in the vault. A user can call `initialize` on the template contract, and set some tokens as `trackedTokens`. When the factory clones this template, the cloned contract will also have a copy of the `trackedTokens` mapping. This can be used to gas grief the creation of new vaults, or to push unnecessary tokens into this mapping.

Malicious users just need to call the `initialize` function on the template contract.

```solidity
function initialize(
        IERC20 baseAsset_,
        IERC20 underlyer_,
        IMainRewarder rewarder_,
        address[] memory additionalTrackedTokens_,
        bytes memory
    ) public virtual initializer {

    _addTrackedToken(address(baseAsset_));
    _addTrackedToken(address(underlyer_));
    uint256 attLen = additionalTrackedTokens_.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < attLen; ++i) {
        _addTrackedToken(additionalTrackedTokens_[i]);
    }
```

The `CurveConvexDestinationVault` can be griefed in a similar manner for a higher severity. This can be done by passing values into the `constituentTokens` array, which will break the vault since it will contain bogus tokens in the constituent token array.

```solidity
function initialize(
        IERC20 baseAsset_,
        IERC20 underlyer_,
        IMainRewarder rewarder_,
        address[] memory additionalTrackedTokens_,
        bytes memory params_
    ) public virtual override {
        super.initialize(baseAsset_, underlyer_, rewarder_, additionalTrackedTokens_, params_);
        // ...
        (address[8] memory tokens, uint256 numTokens, address lpToken,) =
            curveResolver.resolveWithLpToken(initParams.curvePool);
        Errors.verifyNotZero(lpToken, "lpToken");
        Errors.verifyNotZero(numTokens, "numTokens");

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < numTokens; ++i) {
            address weth = address(_systemRegistry.weth());
            address token = tokens[i] == LibAdapter.CURVE_REGISTRY_ETH_ADDRESS_POINTER ? weth : tokens[i];

            _addTrackedToken(token);
            constituentTokens.push(token);
        }
```

A malicious user can initialize this function with some random curve pool address. This will cause the `constituentTokens` array to contain the tokens of that curve pool. When the factory creates clones from this template, it will carry over the `constituentTokens` array and push more tokens into it. Thus in the final vault created, the `constituentTokens` array will have a bunch of bogus tokens.

So the uninitialized templates can be initialized by malicious actors to gas grief by adding a bunch of bogus tokens in tracked tokens, and add more bogus tokens in curve vault's constituent tokens. This can be a source of misinformation, and since this messes with the configuration of the protocol, is deemed a medium severity issue.

## Impact

Actors can cause gas griefing and can add random tokens to tracked tokens and constituent tokens. This can prevent the functionality of the `recover` functions, since they rely on the recover target not being in the tracked tokens array.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the `_disableInitializers()` function call in the constructor of the `DestinationVault.sol` contract. This will prevent the `initialize` function from being called on the template contracts. This is already present in `LMPVault.sol`, but missing in the destination templates.
