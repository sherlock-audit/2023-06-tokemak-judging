# safeApprove() revert causing DoS
## Summary
`safeApprove()` will revert when increase or decrease current allowance.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `approve()` function in `PeripheryPayments.sol` contract uses ERC20 `safeApprove()` from OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library to give allowance.

```solidity
function approve(IERC20 token, address to, uint256 amount) public payable {
        token.safeApprove(to, amount); 
    }
```

However, the safeApprove function prevents changing an allowance between non-zero values to mitigate a possible front-running attack. It reverts if that is the case. Instead, the safeIncreaseAllowance and safeDecreaseAllowance functions should be used. Comment from the OZ library for this function: “// safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance, // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use // `safeIncreaseAllowance` and `safeDecreaseAllowance`"

## Impact
If the existing allowance is non-zero, then safeApprove() will revert causing the user’s token deposits to fail leading to denial-of-service.
