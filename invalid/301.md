# Miss-pricing of lp tokens due to not handling the `type(uint211).max` returned by totalSupply.
## Summary
Miss-pricing of lp tokens due to not handling the `type(uint211).max` returned by totalSupply.

## Vulnerability Detail
New balancer pools with pre-minted BPT will always return type(uint211).max if totalSupply is used.	
In Tokemak's case, `totalSupply()` is used to calculate the price of the Lp token. 
This will result in a wrong price for the Lp token for new pools as they come with pre-minted BPT, and they always return `type(uint211).max` as the [totalSupply](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/advanced/valuing-bpt/valuing-bpt.html#on-chain).

```solidity
 uint256 totalSupply = pool.totalSupply();
```

## Impact
This will result in a wrong price for the Lp token for new pools

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When fetching the supply from balancer pools add the check that:

```solidity
require(supply != uint211, "incorrect pool type"); 
```
So, it does not miss-calculate the price of the lpToken.
