# DestinationVault._beforeTokenTransfer() calls mainRewarder.withdraw() which attempts to withdraw from `ExtraRewarder` contract that was never set for Destination vaults
## Summary
when destination Vaults are launched from DestinationVaultFactory.sol via the create() function by the` vault Creator `,  `allowExtraRewards` bool is set to false by default [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVaultFactory.sol#L84).

Now since `allowExtraReward` is set to false by default for Destination Vaults, `DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` role will never be able to set `ExtraReward` contract via MainRewarder.addExtraReward()  because of this check [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L53-L54)

The issue lies in mainRewarder.withdraw() and mainRewarder.stake() which DestinationVault._beforeTokenTransfer() and DestinationVault._afterTokenTransfer() attempts to call.

mainRewarder.withdraw() runs a for loop across extraRewards.length and attempts to withdraw from `ExtraRewarder` contract that was never set for DestinationVaults.

Same logic exists in  mainRewarder.stake().

## Vulnerability Detail
mainRewarder.withdraw() and mainRewarder.stake() runs a for loop across extraRewards.length and attempts to withdraw and stake on  `ExtraRewarder` contract that was never set for DestinationVaults, this will always cause reverts

## Impact
DestinationVault._beforeTokenTransfer() and DestinationVault._afterTokenTransfer() hooks override base ERC20's own and therefore will be called  before and after all token transfers and be used to track the balances in the rewarder 

This issue will always revert token transfers as the `ExtraRewarder` contract in mainRewarder.sol was never set for DestinationVaults

## Tool used

Classical Music and Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow atleast one `ExtraRewarder` contract to be set in mainRewarder.sol for DestinationVaults, since the `ExtraRewarder` contract does the main withdrawals and staking in the rewarder.
