# staking points could be exceeded
## Summary
when extending the lockup period for additional points, the number of maximum allowed staking points could be exceeded
## Vulnerability Detail
in GPToke  a staker has the option to extend their staking period for additional points. they simply pass in the duration. then they are issued with additional points and new end time.
however there is no check to make sure that the new points + totalSupply do not exceed type(uint192).max which is checked during the first staking.
## Impact
the total number of point could be inflated by a rogue staker, thus diluting the voting power of other stakers

## Recommendation
introduce  if (points + totalSupply() > type(uint192).max) {
            revert StakingPointsExceeded();
        }
