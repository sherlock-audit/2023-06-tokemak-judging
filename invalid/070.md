# Using block.timestamp as the deadline/expiry invites MEV
## Summary
Using Block.timestamp as deadline/expiry in swaps makes them vulnerable to malicious miners.

## Vulnerability Detail
Passing block.timestamp as the expiry/deadline of an operation does not mean "require immediate execution" - it means "whatever block this transaction appears in, I'm comfortable with that block's timestamp". 

Providing this value means that a malicious miner can hold the transaction for as long as they like (think the flashbots mempool for bundling transactions), which may be until they are able to cause the transaction to incur the maximum amount of slippage allowed by the slippage parameter, or until conditions become unfavorable enough that other orders, e.g. liquidations, are triggered. 

Timestamps should be chosen off-chain, and should be specified by the caller to avoid unnecessary MEV.

## Impact
Malicious miners can hold the transaction for as long as they like, which may be until they are able to cause the transaction to incur the maximum amount of slippage allowed by the slippage parameter, or until conditions become unfavorable enough
