# mint/deposit on LMPVaultRouterBase handle ETH input separately from the amountIn
## Summary
mint/deposit on LMPVaultRouterBase handle ETH input separately from the amountIn.

## Vulnerability Detail
msg.value is not checked to be equal to the shares/amount with which deposit/mint are called.

Alice calls deposit with msg.value that is different than amount and receives her shares.
Bob sees that the Ether balance of the vault contract is non-zero and calls deposit with the excess amount of Alice's actual sent in ETH <=> the specified amount and receives the excess amount sent from Alice in shares.

```solidity
    function mint(
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 shares,
        uint256 maxAmountIn
    ) public payable virtual override returns (uint256 amountIn) {
        // handle possible eth
        _processEthIn(vault);

        IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
        uint256 assets = vault.previewMint(shares);
        pullToken(vaultAsset, assets, address(this));
        vaultAsset.safeApprove(address(vault), assets);

        amountIn = vault.mint(shares, to);
        if (amountIn > maxAmountIn) {
            revert MaxAmountError();
        }
    }

    /// @inheritdoc ILMPVaultRouterBase
    function deposit(
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minSharesOut
    ) public payable virtual override returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
        // handle possible eth
        _processEthIn(vault);

        IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
        pullToken(vaultAsset, amount, address(this));

        return _deposit(vault, to, amount, minSharesOut);
    }
```

## Impact
loss of user funds if excess ETH was sent with the call to the function, relative to the specified minSharesOut.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
handle possible ETH input as the swapped asset separately in another function that does not take shares/amount as input argument, but use `msg.value` as so.
