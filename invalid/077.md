# Array Mismatch in `removeLiquidity` Function
## Summary
The `removeLiquidity` function allows users to withdraw liquidity from a Balancer or Beethoven pool. However, the function does not include a check to ensure that the arrays of token addresses to withdraw (`tokens`) and the corresponding exact amounts of tokens to be withdrawn from the pool (`exactAmountsOut`) have the same length. This lack of validation can lead to an array mismatch, potentially causing unexpected behavior and errors during the liquidity withdrawal process.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `removeLiquidity` function takes two arrays as input: `tokens` and `exactAmountsOut`. These arrays are expected to have the same length, where each element in the tokens array corresponds to the exact amount of `tokens` to be withdrawn from the pool in the `exactAmountsOut` array. However, the function lacks explicit validation to ensure this requirement.
```solidity
function removeLiquidity(
    IVault vault,
    address pool,
    address[] calldata tokens,
    uint256[] calldata exactAmountsOut,
    uint256 maxLpBurnAmount
) public returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts) {
    // ... function logic ...
}
```
## Impact
The impact of this array mismatch vulnerability can be significant. If the `tokens` and `exactAmountsOut` arrays have different lengths, the function may not function as expected. It could lead to incorrect withdrawal amounts, unexpected results, or even revert the transaction, causing inconvenience to users and disrupting the intended functionality of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the array mismatch issue, the function should include a check to verify that both `tokens` and `exactAmountsOut` arrays have the same length. A suitable check could be added at the beginning of the function:
```solidity
require(tokens.length == exactAmountsOut.length, "Array length mismatch");
```
