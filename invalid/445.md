# Rebalance reverts due to insuficient token amounts if users withdraw transactions frontrun the rebalance call
## Summary
The [`rebalance()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L691) calls transfer out if [`baseAsset`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L398) else [`withdrawUnderlying()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L377) from a vault. If a `withdraw()` transaction frontruns the `rebalance()` call, there might not be enough balance to proceed and it reverts (on [`withdrawUnderlying()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L390) or [`safeTransfer()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L406)). Can be used by attackers to intentionally DoS rebalancing.

## Vulnerability Detail
[`withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L414) or [`redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L433) call `_withdraw()`, which [withdraws the `_baseAsset`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L483) from the destination vaults if not enough is in idle.

The [`rebalance()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L691) calls specify [`params.amountOut`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L376), which is the quantity to either transfer to the `receiver` if the [`params.tokenOut` is the `params._baseAsset`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L406) or [`withdrawUnderlying()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L390) otherwise.

In both scenarios, the rebalancer might be expecting the `LMPVault` to have a certain balance of a token to transfer out (or withdraw), but it might not be there due to withdrawals that frontrun the rebalance transaction. This could either happen naturally or a malicious user might frontrun such transactions on purpose to harm the protocol.

## Impact
Temporary DoS of the `rebalance()` functionality. How long the DoS can be sustained depends on factors such has the amount of shares that a malicious attacker has. If it has enough shares, technically it could halt the rebalances indefinitely or force the rebalancer to rebalance in very small amounts at a time.

Either way, the function call might revert naturally without malicious intent, which would still cause harm to the protocol.

A test was added to `LMPVault-Withdraw.t.sol` as a POC:
```solidity
function test_POC_DoS_Rebalance_EitherMaliciouslyOrNot_notEnoughBalance_OnTokenOut() public {
    _accessController.grantRole(Roles.SOLVER_ROLE, address(this));
    _accessController.grantRole(Roles.LMP_FEE_SETTER_ROLE, address(this));

    // User is going to deposit 1000 asset
    _asset.mint(address(this), 1000);
    _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);
    _lmpVault.deposit(1000, address(this));

    // Deployed 1000 asset to DV1
    _underlyerOne.mint(address(this), 500);
    _underlyerOne.approve(address(_lmpVault), 500);
    _lmpVault.rebalance(
        address(_destVaultOne),
        address(_underlyerOne), // tokenIn
        500,
        address(0), // destinationOut, none when sending out baseAsset
        address(_asset), // baseAsset, tokenOut
        1000
    );

    _lmpVault.redeem(1, address(this), address(this));
    
    // [FAIL. Reason: ERC20: burn amount exceeds balance]
    // tries to withdraw 500 underlying, but only 499 is available due to user redeem above
    vm.expectRevert();
    _lmpVault.rebalance( // this rebalance makes no sense, just for illustration of the issue
        address(0),
        address(0), // tokenIn
        0,
        address(_destVaultOne), // destinationOut, none when sending out baseAsset
        address(_underlyerOne), // baseAsset, tokenOut
        500
    );
}
```
The scenario where the `tokenOut` is the `_baseAsset` is similar, so a POC was not coded.

## Code Snippet
In `LMPDebt:_handleRebalanceOut()`, too many assets may be attempted to be withdrawn or transferred:
```solidity
function _handleRebalanceOut(
    RebalanceOutParams memory params,
    DestinationInfo storage destOutInfo
) private returns (IdleDebtChange memory assetChange) {
    ...
    if (params.amountOut > 0) {
        if (params.tokenOut != address(params._baseAsset)) {
            ...
            dvOut.withdrawUnderlying(params.amountOut, params.receiver);
            ...
        } else {
            ...
            IERC20(params.tokenOut).safeTransfer(params.receiver, params.amountOut);
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Limit the amount out to the available balance of the `LMPVault`, this way no DoS or unexpected revert is possible.
