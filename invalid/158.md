# Uniswap v3 transaction could leak value due to no deadline check
## Summary
Uniswap v3 [uses](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/UniV3Swap.sol#L59) `block.timestamp` as a deadline check, which in itself is useless. This could result in the transaction being stuck in the mempool for a long time and to execute in bad terms.

## Vulnerability Detail
Using `block.timestamp` as a deadline is highly discouraged, since `block.timestamp` is when the transaction is executed and does not matter when it's executed (in 1 hour, 1 day or even 1 month)it will pas the the trade will succeed. This is an issue since 2 thing can happen.
1. The trade to be too late and the user to changed his mind or forgotten it altogether.
 - User might have already changed his mind or forgotten altogether about this trade.

2. The trade to execute at bad terms thus lowering the value that the user receives. 
  - Due to the lack of slippage in some places the trade TX can be called for **USDT : WETH** with 1800 **USDT**, when the price is `1800 : 1` and execute when the price is `2000 : 1`, and the end user to receive less WETH than he intended.

3. The trade can execute spontaneously without the user's knowledge.

  
## Impact
Lack of deadline check can lead to user losing funds or trade executing at unexpected times.

```jsx
        IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
            path: data,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp, //@audit no deadline check?
            amountIn: sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: minBuyAmount
        });
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Uses 0 as a [deadline check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/UniV3Swap.sol#L59). This will mean if the TX is not executed at the block that is send it will revert.

```jsx
 deadline:0,
