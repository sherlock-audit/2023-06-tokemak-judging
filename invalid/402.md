# Extremely high feeBps value can be set to take more fees than intended
## Summary
The calculateFee function is vulnerable to an attacker setting an extremely high feeBps value that could allow them to take more fees than intended.
## Vulnerability Detail
The feeBps variable is a uint256, which means it can hold values up to 2^256 - 1. However, the calculateFee function expects feeBps to be in basis points, where 1 basis point is 0.01%.
So if feeBps is set to a very large uint256 value like 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935, then calculating the fee percentage will cause an overflow and return an incorrect fee amount.
Here is the relevant code: [Link 1 ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L46) and [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L99-L101)
The MAX_PCT constant is 10,000, which represents 100% in basis points. When taking a very large feeBps and multiplying it by the amount, it will overflow and return an incorrect fee. This could allow an attacker to set an extremely high feeBps and drain a large percentage of funds as fees.
## Impact
An attacker can set an extremely high fee and drain a large percentage of funds as fees.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
feeBps should be explicitly set as a uint32 or uint16 to restrict the range of acceptable values
