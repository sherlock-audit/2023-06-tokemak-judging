# Zero Slippage Protection in `swap` Function
## Summary
The `swap` function in the provided contract lacks slippage protection, which can expose users to potential financial losses due to unexpected price fluctuations during token swaps.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `swap` function in the contract is designed to facilitate token swaps between two tokens based on the provided parameters. While the function handles input validation, token approvals, and swap execution, it does not account for the possibility of slippage â€“ the difference between the expected and actual execution prices of a trade.

In the absence of slippage protection, the contract executes the swap at the aggregator's determined price without considering potential price changes that might occur between the initiation and execution of the swap. This exposes users to the risk of receiving a different amount of tokens than they expected due to sudden market fluctuations.
```solidity
// Contract function that lacks slippage protection
function swap(SwapParams memory swapParams) public virtual nonReentrant returns (uint256 buyTokenAmountReceived) {
    // ... (input validation, approvals, and swap execution)

    uint256 buyTokenBalanceBefore = buyToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    
    // Swap execution, not accounting for potential slippage
    
    uint256 buyTokenBalanceAfter = buyToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    buyTokenAmountReceived = buyTokenBalanceAfter - buyTokenBalanceBefore;

    // ... (validation, event emission, and result return)
}

```
## Impact
The absence of slippage protection in the token swap function can lead to financial losses for users. If the execution price of the swap deviates significantly from the expected price due to market volatility, users might receive fewer tokens than anticipated. This can result in unfavorable trade outcomes and potential dissatisfaction among users.

## Recommendation
Have a user inputtable `minMintAmountOut` added in the function parameters of `call()` and the function logic.
