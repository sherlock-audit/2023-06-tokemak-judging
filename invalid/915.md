# Anyone can call the PeripheryPayments unwrapWETH9() stealing the weth stored in LMPVaultRouter
## Summary
PeripheryPayments is a dependency of the LMPVaultRouterBase abstract contract, which is a dependency of the LMPVaultRouter contract. PeripheryPayments has a unwrapWETH9() with no access control which allows a caller to the contractâ€™s weth balance from the BunniHub contract to any recipient.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function unwrapWETH9(uint256 amountMinimum, address recipient) public payable {
        uint256 balanceWETH9 = weth9.balanceOf(address(this));

        if (balanceWETH9 < amountMinimum) revert InsufficientWETH9();

        if (balanceWETH9 > 0) {
            weth9.withdraw(balanceWETH9);
            Address.sendValue(payable(recipient), balanceWETH9);
        }
    }
```

## Impact
Anyone can take the WETH stored in the LMPVaultRouter contract.

## Code Snippet
Dependencies

```solidity
contract LMPVaultRouter is ILMPVaultRouter, LMPVaultRouterBase {
```

```solidity
abstract contract LMPVaultRouterBase is ILMPVaultRouterBase, SelfPermit, Multicall, PeripheryPayments {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove or add access control to the PeripheryPayments unwrapWETH9() function.
