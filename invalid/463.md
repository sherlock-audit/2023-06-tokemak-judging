# rewardPerTokenStored can be inflated and rewards can be stolen
## Summary
`rewardPerTokenStored` in `_updateReward` can be inflated and rewards can be stolen

## Vulnerability Detail

This vulnerability is the same as the one from [veToken](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-vetoken-findings/issues/201).
When a user calls `stake()` with 1 wei, it updates the `totalSupply` as 1 wei and the rewards through `_updateReward` function. This function calls `rewardPerToken()` to assign the return value to `rewardPerTokenStored` and assigns it to the account via `userRewardPerTokenPaid[account] = rewardPerTokenStored;`

As `rewardPerToken()` depends on the denominator as totalSupply(), the whole multiplying will be divided by 1 wei which will inflate the `rewardPerTokenStored` astronomically. And there is no obstacle for the user to withdraw it in the withdraw function.


## Impact

The first user who calls MainRewarder's `stake()` function with 1 wei can inflate the `rewardPerTokenStored`. And the same user can call withdraw and drain the rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review + in-house tool

## Recommendation

The team might consider to add boundaries to reward the stakers to be consistent inside the limits.
