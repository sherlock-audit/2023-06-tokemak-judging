# `LMPVaultRouter.sol` receives Ether with the withdraw sub function, but there is no `receive()` function to receive it
## Summary
The LMPVaultRouter contract receives Ether from the WETH contract with the `withdraw()` function, but the contract does not have a `receive()` or `fallback()` function that can receive Ether


## Vulnerability Detail

`LMPVaultRouter.withdrawToDeposit()` function has `withdraw()` sub function, this function call to WETH contract for receive Ether for send to user


```solidity

v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouter.sol:
  29:     function withdrawToDeposit(
  30:         ILMPVault fromVault,
  31:         ILMPVault toVault,
  32:         address to,
  33:         uint256 amount,
  34:         uint256 maxSharesIn,
  35:         uint256 minSharesOut
  36:     ) external override returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
  37:         withdraw(fromVault, address(this), amount, maxSharesIn, false);
  38:         return _deposit(toVault, to, amount, minSharesOut);
  39:     }

```

see to `withdraw()` sub function;

```solidity
v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol:
  73:     function withdraw(
  74:         ILMPVault vault,
  75:         address to,
  76:         uint256 amount,
  77:         uint256 maxSharesOut,
  78:         bool unwrapWETH
  79:     ) public virtual override returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
  80:         address destination = unwrapWETH ? address(this) : to;
  81: 
  82:         sharesOut = vault.withdraw(amount, destination, msg.sender);
  83:         if (sharesOut > maxSharesOut) {
  84:             revert MaxSharesError();
  85:         }
  86: 
  87:         if (unwrapWETH) {
  88:             _processWethOut(to); // @audit-issue 
  89:         }
  90:     }
```

see to `_processWethOut()` sub function;
Here, Ether is sent from the WETH contract to the `to` address, that is to the contract, but there is no receive function in the contract to receive Ether.

```solidity
v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol:
  124:     function _processWethOut(address to) internal {
  125:         uint256 balanceWETH9 = weth9.balanceOf(address(this));
  126: 
  127:         if (balanceWETH9 > 0) {
  128:             weth9.withdraw(balanceWETH9);
  129:             Address.sendValue(payable(to), balanceWETH9);
  130:         }
  131:     }
```



## Impact


Poc;
```solidity
    function testWithdraw() public {
        uint256 startingBalance = address(this).balance;

        weth.deposit{value: 1 ether}();

        weth.withdraw(1 ether);

        uint256 balanceAfterWithdraw = address(this).balance;

        assertEq(balanceAfterWithdraw, startingBalance);
        assertEq(weth.balanceOf(address(this)), 0);
        assertEq(weth.totalSupply(), 0);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation
Add receive() function like a below


```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Only WETH contract is allowed to transfer ETH here. Prevent other addresses to send Ether to this contract.
     */
    receive() external payable {
        require(msg.sender == address(WETH), "Receive not allowed");
    }

    /**
     * @dev Revert fallback calls
     */
    fallback() external payable {
        revert("Fallback not allowed");
    }
```
