# Sandwich attacks against swap TX to drain assets from LMPVault
## Summary

Malicious users could perform sandwich attacks against the TX that swaps non-based assets to base assets to drain assets from LMPVault.

## Vulnerability Detail

> **Important**
> It is important to note that the slippage configured by the users in the router contract is not relevant in the context of this issue. User-defined slippage is to ensure that the user receives the right amount of assets back during redemption OR restrict the number of LMPVault shares being burned while withdrawing a fixed amount of assets. 
>
> This issue occurs because the LMPVault will always attempt to fulfill the user's requested assets regardless of the slippage that occurs while swapping non-based assets to based assets. Regardless of how bad the slippage is in the current market condition if a user requests 50 WETH to be withdrawn, the system will always try its best to deliver 50 WETH.

Assume the following scenario:

- One WETH LMPVault with two destination vaults (DVs)
- One is Curve stETH/ETH DV, and another is Balancer wstETH/WETH DV
- Both DVs are profitable. Thus, there are no restrictions on the withdrawal. Anyone can burn all the DV shares in one go.
- WETH LMPVault's `totalIdle` is zero and `totalDebt` is 100 WETH. 50 WETH has been allocated to each of the two DVs.
- Curve DV has 50 steCRV LP Token. For simplicity's sake, assume the following:
  - 1 steCRV is worth 1 ETH
  - The pool allocation is 50% stETH and 50% ETH
  - 1 stETH:1ETH.

- Balance DV has 50 B-stETH-STABLE BPT. For simplicity's sake, assuming the following:
  - 1 B-stETH-STABLE BPT is worth 1 ETH
  - The pool allocation is 50% wstETH and 50% WETH
  - 1 wstETH:1WETH.

- One DV share is equal to 1 Curve LP Token or Balancer BPT (1:1)

When the `DestinationVault.withdrawBaseAsset` function is triggered, it will call the `DestinationVault._burnUnderlyer` function to burn the underlying (LP Token) to perform a proportional exit to obtain the pool tokens.

Assume that a user attempts to withdraw 20 WETH of assets from the LMPVault (`assets = 20 WETH`). Since the LMPVault's `totalIdle` is zero, `totalAssetsToPull` will be the entire withdrawal amount of 20 WETH, meaning all amounts must be obtained from the DVs.

Within the [`_withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L448) function, the system will loop through each DV in sequence and burn its shares until it reaches the target amount (`totalAssetsToPull`) of 20 WETH.

Under normal circumstances, the code will burn 20 Curve DV shares, which in turn burn 20 steCRV LP Tokens to obtain 10 stETH and 10 ETH. Assume that Uniswap has been configured by the protocol to be the most optimal route for stETH <> ETH swap. The 10 stETH (non-base asset) will be swapped to 10 ETH (base asset) through the Uniswap stETH<>ETH pool. A total of 20 ETH will be obtained, and they will be transferred to the user.

However, a malicious user can perform a classic sandwich attack against the Uniswap pool swap. The attacker front-runs the TX and raises the price of the stETH in the Uniswap stETH<>ETH pool and increases the slippage. Since the slippage has been disabled in Line 273 below, the protocol will continue to buy stETH at a high price. Thus, when the 10 stETH (non-base asset) is being swapped, only 5 ETH is received. The attacker will then sell at a higher price to earn a profit.

```solidity
File: DestinationVault.sol
244:     function withdrawBaseAsset(uint256 shares, address to) external returns (uint256 amount) {
..SNIP..
260:         // Swap what we receive if not already in base asset
261:         // This fn is only called during a users withdrawal. The user should be making this
262:         // call via the LMP Router, or through one of the other routes where
263:         // slippage is controlled for. 0 min amount is expected here.
264:         ISwapRouter swapRouter = _systemRegistry.swapRouter();
265:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < nTokens; ++i) {
266:             address token = tokens[i];
267: 
268:             if (token == _baseAsset) {
269:                 amount += amounts[i];
270:             } else {
271:                 if (amounts[i] > 0) {
272:                     IERC20(token).safeApprove(address(swapRouter), amounts[i]);
273:                     amount += swapRouter.swapForQuote(token, amounts[i], _baseAsset, 0);
274:                 }
275:             }
276:         }
```

A total of 15 ETH is received from burning 20 steCRV LP Tokens since only 5 ETH is received from the swap (10 ETH + 5 ETH from swap).

There is still a shortfall of 5 ETH. Thus, the code will move on to the Balancer DV, and attempt to burn 5 B-stETH-STABLE BPT to obtain the remaining 5 ETH to meet the target amount of 20 ETH. Once 20 ETH is collected, they will be transferred to the users.

In the end, the attacker successfully steals ~5 ETH that initially belonged to the LMPVault. The attacker could gain more by exploiting every DV in the withdrawal queue.


## Impact

Assets in the vault could be lost and stolen by malicious users

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing a mechanism to detect potential manipulation or MEV attacks (e.g., sandwich attacks) during the swap (Non-Based assets => Based assets). 

For instance, the acceptable slippage rate could be computed on the fly by fetching on-chain market conditions via secure oracle so that if the slippage deviates from the acceptable rate, the swap can be prevented to avoid excessive loss.
