# Malicious LIQUIDATOR_ROLE can change feeBps to steal almost all the amoun received from swap
## Summary
`LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` ( malicious or not ) can set `feeBps` to 100% rates to steal almost all the amount received from the swap in the liquidation process for a specific token across a list of vaults.

## Vulnerability Detail
A `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` has the ability to set `feeBps` and `feeReceiver` to any arbitrary value. for example can set  `feeBps` to `99%`.

```solidity
    function setFeeAndReceiver(address _feeReceiver, uint256 _feeBps) external hasRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE) {
        // feeBps should be less than or equal to MAX_PCT (100%) to prevent overflows
        if (_feeBps > MAX_PCT) revert FeeTooHigh();

        feeBps = _feeBps;
        // slither-disable-next-line missing-zero-check
        feeReceiver = _feeReceiver;
    }
```
and `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` has the ability to conduct the liquidation process for a specific token across a list of vaults and initiate the swap process via the asyncSwapper. When the swap is done by `AsyncSwapper`, the fee should be calculated and transferred to `feeReceiver's` address.
```solidity
        // the swapper checks that the amount received is greater or equal than the params.buyAmount
        uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);

        // if the fee feature is turned on, send the fee to the fee receiver
        if (feeReceiver != address(0) && feeBps > 0) {
            uint256 fee = calculateFee(amountReceived);
            emit FeesTransfered(feeReceiver, amountReceived, fee);

            // adjust the amount received after deducting the fee
            amountReceived -= fee;
            // transfer fee to the fee receiver
            IERC20(params.buyTokenAddress).safeTransfer(feeReceiver, fee);
        }
```
A `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` has the ability to set `feeBps`  to `99%` and transfer almost all the amount of `amountReceived` to the `feeReceiver's` address.

```solidity
    function calculateFee(uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
        return (amount * feeBps) / MAX_PCT; // MAX_PCT = 10_000
    }
```

## Impact
A malicious `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` can steal users' rewards.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
`setFeeAndReceiver` should be restricted with a timelock.
