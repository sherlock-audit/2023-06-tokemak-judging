# Stuck rewards in GPToke.sol
## Summary
Under certain conditions, lower bounds of rewards to GPToke.sol can be stuck in the contract. In relation to this, during the execution of  `AddWethRewards()`  a rounding down to zero calculation might be expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

I engaged in a discussion with the protocol team regarding the viability of this particular scenario for the purpose of submission. It was mutually concurred that the scenario bears feasibility, prompting the teamâ€™s recognition of the necessity to address it appropriately. 

 
Please refer to the following lines in:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L235 

Upon executing the calculation denoted as `amount * REWARD_FACTOR / supply`, it is possible that the quotient resulting from the division may be rounded down to zero. In the event of such an occurrence, all sended WETH would be stuck within the contract, given that it remains unallocated to the `accRewardPerShare` variable, which constitutes the basis for distributing rewards to the stakers. 

### Possible scenario
- The protocol team confirmed that the lower bound for rewards would be 0.5 WETH.
- Suppose almost all MAX supply of Toke tokens will be staked in a contract for 15 years (Max stake duration could be changed in GPToke.sol). The total supply will be bigger than `0.6 WETH * Reward_factor`, **leading to rounding down to zero.** -> 0.6 WETH will be stuck in the contract, and no rewards will be distributed.
- *Note: It is important to highlight that the expanse of 15 years may appear extensive. The number of minted new points increases after time progresses, so if you stake after 11 years, that same amount of tokens for four years (which aligns with the default max stake duration), you get an equivalent amount of points as expounded in the previous assertion.*

Naturally, the number of years and amount of staked tokens could be decreased if rewards are lower to fulfill the rounding down to zero scenario.
 
### POC
The following test is supporting the scenario described above.
```Solidity
function test_RewardsGoTo0() external {
        //@audit-issue rounding to zero issue
        uint256 stakedAmmount = MAX_STAKE_AMOUNT - 1 - gpToke.totalSupply();
        uint256 beforeRewarding = gpToke.accRewardPerShare();
        deal(address(toke), address(this), stakedAmmount);
        toke.approve(address(gpToke), stakedAmmount);
        gpToke.setMaxStakeDuration(ONE_YEAR * 15);

        gpToke.stake(stakedAmmount, ONE_YEAR * 15, address(this));
        deal(address(weth), address(this), 1 ether);
        weth.approve(address(gpToke), 1 ether);
        gpToke.addWETHRewards(0.5 ether);
        uint256 afterRewarding = gpToke.accRewardPerShare();
        assert(beforeRewarding == afterRewarding); // 0 == 0 :( , 0.6 ETH is stuck in GPToke.sol forever
    }
```

## Impact
Stuck of rewards within GPToke.sol under certain conditions.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Always check if the result of the following calculations is not zero.

```Solidity
uint rewardsToAdd = amount * REWARD_FACTOR / supply;
if (rewardsToAdd != 0){
	accRewardPerShare += rewardsToAdd;
}
else{
	revert();
}
```
