# A malicious liquidator could divert fees to any address
## Summary
The setFeeAndReceiver() function only checks that the caller has the LIQUIDATOR_ROLE. It does not check that the caller is an authorized fee setter or administrator:
## Vulnerability Detail
The setFeeAndReceiver() function only checks that the caller has the LIQUIDATOR_ROLE role: This means any address with the LIQUIDATOR_ROLE can set the _feeReceiver to any arbitrary address.

A malicious liquidator could exploit this by:
- Obtaining the LIQUIDATOR_ROLE role, either by creating the contract themselves or through some vulnerability.
- Calling setFeeAndReceiver() and setting _feeReceiver to their own address or another malicious address.
- When fees are collected in _performLiquidation(), they will be sent to the malicious address instead of the intended recipient.
## Impact
This would result in loss of fees that should be going to the protocol.

## Recommendation
the setFeeAndReceiver() function should also check that the new _feeReceiver is a valid, authorized address,
