# sqrt() has a rounding error, as a result, getPriceInEth() will break for some cases. User might lose funds due to unable to trade with a breaking getPriceIneth().
## Summary
Due to rounding error, sqrt() and getPriceInEth() will break for some cases (for example, when assetPrice = 1e18+2 or assetPrice = 1e18-2. Both functions will break, and a user can not trade, which might result in loss of funds. I label this as a medium since there is probability that this might happen according to Sherlock policies. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The main idea of sqrt() is that: let y be the former approximation of sqrt of x, and let z be a new approximation of sqrt by taking the average of ``x * 10 ** 18 / z`` and ``z``, if y == z then return y. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/CurveV2CryptoEthOracle.sol#L174-L192](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/CurveV2CryptoEthOracle.sol#L174-L192)

This condition is too strong for some cases. This is because it is possible 
(x * 10 ** 18 / z + z) / 2 might have a rounding error of 1 when (x * 10 ** 18 / z + z) is an odd number.  In this case,  y will never be equal to z - it will be off by 1. 

Therefore, a good condition would be ``y == z || y == z +1 || y == z - 1``. 

Counter example: for example, when x = 1e18+2 or when x = 1e18 - 2 , the code will not work - it will revert with SqrtError(), As a result, for some cases, for example, when when assetPrice = 1e18+2 or assetPrice = 1e18-2, sqrt() will break. Since getPriceInEth() calls sqrt(), it will break as well. The user might lose funds due to not be able to trade under such cases. 

The POC code below show how the rounding error can lead to the revert of sqrt():

import "forge-std/Test.sol";



contract MyTest is Test {

    error SqrtError();

    function setUp() public {
 
    }



 function sqrt(uint256 x) private pure returns (uint256) {
        if (x == 0) return 0;

        uint256 z = (x + 10 ** 18) / 2;
        uint256 y = x;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 256;) {
            if (z == y) {
                return y;
            }
            y = z;
            z = (x * 10 ** 18 / z + z) / 2;

            console2.log("ite: %d:", i);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        revert SqrtError();
    }


function testMe() public{
    console2.log("sqr2 1: %d", sqrt(1e18+2));
 
}
}
```



## Impact
Due to the strong condition, the function will treat some cases as revert error even though it can return a good approximation. Both sqrt() and getPriceInEth() will break under such cases. A user might lose funding if he cannot trade under such cases. This is a medium since it might happen.

## Recommendation
Change the condition to  ``y == z || y == z +1 || y == z - 1``:

```diff
function sqrt(uint256 x) private pure returns (uint256) {
        if (x == 0) return 0;

        uint256 z = (x + 10 ** 18) / 2;
        uint256 y = x;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 256;) {
-            if (z == y) {
+           if (y == z || y == z +1 || y == z - 1) {
                return y;
            }
            y = z;
            z = (x * 10 ** 18 / z + z) / 2;

            console2.log("ite: %d:", i);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        revert SqrtError();
    }
```
