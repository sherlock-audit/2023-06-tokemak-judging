# `GPToke` contract is not paused when the whole system is paused
## Summary

The `GPToke` contract is a pausable contract but it uses the OZ Pausable extension and not the custom `security/Pausable` extension developed by the protocol, so when the whole system is paused `isSystemPaused() == true` the `GPToke` contract will not get immediately paused until his owner call its `pause` function, thus all the `GPToke` functionalities will be active even in emergency situations (whole system paused).

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue occurs in the `GPToke` contract which uses the OZ Pausable extension and its correspanding `_pause/_unpause` functionalities :

```solidity
import { Pausable } from "openzeppelin-contracts/security/Pausable.sol";
```

```solidity
function pause() external onlyOwner {
    _pause();
}

function unpause() external onlyOwner {
    _unpause();
}
```

In the `SystemSecurity` contract we can find the following statement :

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Cross-contract system-level functionality around pausing and various security features.
 * Allows us to pause all pausable contracts in the system
 * Ensures that operations that change NAV and those that don't are not mixed in the same transaction.
*/
```

This means that all the pausable contract in the system should get paused if the `_systemPaused` is set to `true` regardless of their own pausing status. This is achived through the custom `security/Pausable` extension which have the following definition for paused status :

```solidity
function paused() public view virtual returns (bool) {
    return _paused || _systemSecurity.isSystemPaused();
}
```

It's clear that regadless of the `_paused` value if `_systemSecurity.isSystemPaused()` is true the contract will be in paused state, the issue now is that the OZ Pausable extension has different definition for paused status :

```solidity
/**
* @dev Returns true if the contract is paused, and false otherwise.
*/
function paused() public view virtual returns (bool) {
    return _paused;
}
```

Meaning that the `GPToke` contract considers only its own paused status and does not care if system is paused or not, hence in a given emergency situation if the systme get paused all other pausable contracts will get paused but the `GPToke` contract functionalities will still be active until the owner call the `pause()` function.

This goes against the intent of the protocol as when the `EMERGENCY_PAUSER` pauses the whole system in an emergency situation, if he forgets or doesn't notice that `GPToke` is not yet paused, it could result in a misbehaviour of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the custom `security/Pausable` extension in the `GPToke` contract to ensure that all the contract are paused when emergency situation is triggered.
