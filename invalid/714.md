# Fee Calculation Issue Leading to Zero amountReceived in _performLiquidation Function If Fee Is Set To The Max
## Summary
During a manual code review, a potential vulnerability was identified in the smart contract's fee calculation logic, specifically in the _performLiquidation function. The issue arises when the fee basis points (feeBps) is set to the maximum allowed value (MAX_PCT) and the feeReceiver address is valid. This combination can lead to the amountReceived becoming zero due to the way the fee calculation and adjustment are implemented in the code.


## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the interaction between the fee calculation logic and the _performLiquidation function. When the feeBps is set to MAX_PCT and the feeReceiver address is valid, the calculated fee becomes equal to the amountReceived, and subsequent adjustments cause the amountReceived to be reduced to zero.


## Impact
In scenarios where the feeBps is set to MAX_PCT (10000) and the feeReceiver address is valid, the amountReceived value will become zero. This will lead to  a huge loss of funds as the  feeReceiver will recieve the whole amount and mainRewarder will recieve 0.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L94

    function setFeeAndReceiver(address _feeReceiver, uint256 _feeBps) external hasRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE) {
        // feeBps should be less than or equal to MAX_PCT (100%) to prevent overflows
        if (_feeBps > MAX_PCT) revert FeeTooHigh();

        feeBps = _feeBps;
        // slither-disable-next-line missing-zero-check
        feeReceiver = _feeReceiver;
    } 
here _feeBps can equals to MAX_PCT

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L94

    function calculateFee(uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
        return (amount * feeBps) / MAX_PCT;
    }

here since _feeBps == MAX_PCT, multiplying and dividing by the same number would return the same number
so the fee amount would be the entered amount

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L255

    function _performLiquidation(
        uint256 gasBefore,
        address fromToken,
        address asyncSwapper,
        IDestinationVault[] memory vaultsToLiquidate,
        SwapParams memory params,
        uint256 totalBalanceToLiquidate,
        uint256[] memory vaultsBalances
    ) private {
        uint256 length = vaultsToLiquidate.length;
        // the swapper checks that the amount received is greater or equal than the params.buyAmount
        uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);

        // if the fee feature is turned on, send the fee to the fee receiver
        if (feeReceiver != address(0) && feeBps > 0) {
            uint256 fee = calculateFee(amountReceived); // fee ==amountReceived
            emit FeesTransfered(feeReceiver, amountReceived, fee);

            // adjust the amount received after deducting the fee
            amountReceived -= fee; // amountReceived==0
            // transfer fee to the fee receiver
            IERC20(params.buyTokenAddress).safeTransfer(feeReceiver, fee);
        }
    ...
            uint256 amount = amountReceived * vaultsBalances[i] / totalBalanceToLiquidate; // amount == 0

            // approve main rewarder to pull the tokens
            LibAdapter._approve(IERC20(params.buyTokenAddress), address(mainRewarder), amount);
            mainRewarder.queueNewRewards(amount);
..
}

here the feeReceiver will recieve the whole amount and mainRewarder will recieve 0, and in some cases it will revert in case of tokens that doesnt transfer 0 amount.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
 One approach could involve introducing an upper limit for the fee calculation based on a percentage of the amountReceived to not reach 100%.
