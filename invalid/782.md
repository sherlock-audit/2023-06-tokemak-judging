# Incorrect implementation of `claimRewards()` in `AuraRewardsAdapter.sol`
## Summary
Incorrect implementation of `claimRewards()` in `AuraRewardsAdapter.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In `AuraRewardsAdapter.sol`, `claimRewards()` function for other than the recipient is not correctly implemented.

```Solidity
File: src/destinations/adapters/rewards/AuraRewardsAdapter.sol

33    function claimRewards(
34        address gauge,
35        address defaultToken
36    ) public returns (uint256[] memory amounts, address[] memory tokens) {
37        (amounts, tokens) = ConvexRewards.claimRewards(gauge, defaultToken, address(this));
38    }
```

It takes an external function from `ConvexRewardsAdapter.sol` which is `claimRewards()` which is given as below for claiming rewards,

```Solidity
File: src/destinations/adapters/rewards/ConvexRewardsAdapter.sol

    function claimRewards(
        address gauge,
        address defaultToken
    ) public returns (uint256[] memory amounts, address[] memory tokens) {
>>        return _claimRewards(gauge, defaultToken, address(this));
    }
```

Here, it can be seen that the destination address for such reward claims are already hardcoded and there is seperate function made for such reward claims where the other destination address does not need to be passed.

Therefore at L-37, `address(this)` does not need to be repeated for such reward claims.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove `address(this)` at L-37 in `AuraRewardsAdapter.sol`

```diff
File: src/destinations/adapters/rewards/AuraRewardsAdapter.sol

    function claimRewards(
        address gauge,
        address defaultToken
    ) public returns (uint256[] memory amounts, address[] memory tokens) {
-        (amounts, tokens) = ConvexRewards.claimRewards(gauge, defaultToken, address(this));
+       (amounts, tokens) = ConvexRewards.claimRewards(gauge, defaultToken);
    }
