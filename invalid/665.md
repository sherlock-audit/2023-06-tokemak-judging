# Deposits cannot be made when there is no limit for totalSupply and per wallet limit
## Summary
Deposits cannot be made due to overflow when tsLimit == uint256.max && walletLimit == uint256.max as `_maxMint` returns uint256.max under these conditions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The code flow will look like this when a user tries to deposit.

1. `deposit()` is called
2. It calls `maxDeposit()` to check if the assets currently deposited is more than what the user can deposit at maximum
3. `maxDeposit()` calls `convertToAssets()` which calls `_maxMint()`
4. `_maxMint()` returns uint256.max when tsLimit == uint256.max && walletLimit == uint256.max
5. Overflow happens at `convertToAssets()` since uint256.max cannot be multiplied with any number > 0

## Impact
Deposits cannot be made by users when we want to set no limits for total supply and per wallet supply.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider this special case for when we want do not want to restrict total supply and per wallet supply.
