# LMPVault.sol::recover() - L549: Reentrancy potential: via ERC777 callback vulnerable token contract.
## Summary
M: LMPVault.sol::recover() - L549: Reentrancy potential: via ERC777 callback vulnerable token contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Potential damage seems low.

L549: /// @audit no reentrancy protection:

    ) external virtual override hasRole(Roles.TOKEN_RECOVERY_ROLE) {

L568: /// @audit ERC777 token contracts could enable callback:

    IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(destination, amount); 
            
One or more of the safeTransfer() calls inside the `for loop` inside recover() function can call an ERC777 token contract that makes callback possible. An attacker who controls this contract can potentially callback into the LMPVault contact and successfully call several external/public functions. However, it appears as if damage risk is low, as the codebase seems really well written.

## Impact
LOW.

## Code Snippet
L549: /// @audit no reentrancy protection:

    ) external virtual override hasRole(Roles.TOKEN_RECOVERY_ROLE) {

L568: /// @audit ERC777 token contracts could enable callback:

    IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(destination, amount); 

## Tool used
VSC.
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Codebase already well written, but mindfulness of this reentrancy potential is good.
