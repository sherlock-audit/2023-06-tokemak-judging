# Missing Total Supply Check in extend Function
## Summary
The extend function in the smart contract allows users to extend the duration of their staking. However, it fails to check if the added points during the extension exceed the `totalSupply`, a verification that is present in the stake function.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `stake` function, there's a check to ensure that the sum of points and `totalSupply()` does not exceed `type(uint192).max`. This check ensures that the total points in the system remain within a safe limit. However, the extend function, which also potentially increases the total points in the system, lacks this check. This oversight can lead to potential overflow issues or other unintended consequences.

## Impact
This can theoretically break one of the system's invariants.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a check in the `extend` function similar to the one in the `_stake` function.
