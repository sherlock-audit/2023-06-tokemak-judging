# Early Depositor Exploitation in LMPVault Deposit Function
## Summary
A well known attack vector for almost all shares based liquidity pool contracts, where an early user can manipulate the price per share and profit from late users' deposits because of the precision loss caused by the rather large value of price per share.
## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious early user can `deposit()` with `1 wei` of `assets` token as the first depositor of the lmp , and get `1 wei` of shares.

Then the attacker can send `10000e18 - 1` of asset tokens and inflate the price per share from `1.0000` to an extreme value of `1.0000e22 ( from (1 + 10000e18 - 1) / 1)` .

As a result, the future user who deposits `19999e18` will only receive `1 wei` (from `19999e18 * 1 / 10000e18`) of shares token.

They will immediately lose `9999e18` or half of their deposits if they `redeem()` right after the `deposit()`.
## Impact
The inflation attack allows the attacker to profit from future users' deposits, while these later users may suffer substantial losses due to the inflated exchange rate.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a minimum requirement for the amount of shares to be minted for the first depositor. This requirement will discourage attackers from exploiting the vulnerability and manipulating the exchange rate.
```solidity
// Add a new state variable to store the virtual totalAssets
uint256 private virtualTotalAssets;

// ...

function deposit(
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver
) public virtual override nonReentrant noNavChange ensureNoNavOps returns (uint256 shares) {
    Errors.verifyNotZero(assets, "assets");
    if (assets > maxDeposit(receiver)) {
        revert ERC4626DepositExceedsMax(assets, maxDeposit(receiver));
    }

    shares = previewDeposit(assets);

    // Calculate the virtual totalAssets by adding the current totalIdle and totalDebt with the deposited assets
    virtualTotalAssets = totalIdle + totalDebt + assets;

    _transferAndMint(assets, shares, receiver);

    // Reset the virtualTotalAssets to the actual value after the deposit is completed
    virtualTotalAssets = 0;
}
```
