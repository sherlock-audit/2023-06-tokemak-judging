# user's assets can be stuck in the contract, unable to deposit or withdraw
## Summary
If the Balancer pool tokens change, it could break the assumption in the code that the pool.tokens match what is passed in by the user. This could lead to funds being stuck. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The key issue is in [_verifyPoolTokensMatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol#L355-L363) This assumes the tokens array passed in matches the current poolTokens. However, if the pool tokens are changed, such as via a Balancer governance update, then tokens could mismatch poolTokens and cause the transaction to revert.


## Impact
Assets could be stuck in the pool with no way to withdraw them.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Fetch current pool tokens just before any deposit/withdrawal. Don't rely on cached values.
- Build the tokens array to match based on current pool tokens. Don't rely on user input.
