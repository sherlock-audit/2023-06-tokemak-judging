# Possible financial losses in `_withdraw` function caused by underflow issues
## Summary
The `_withdraw` function has issues which can lead to incorrect calculations and unintended behavior during asset withdrawal. The function involves complex calculations while processing withdrawal requests, and it lacks appropriate checks to prevent underflows. As a result, users might face financial losses, and the protocol's stability could be compromised.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_withdraw` function handles the withdrawal of assets and shares from a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. It utilizes a WithdrawInfo struct to track withdrawal-related information, such as idle assets, assets to pull from destinations, idle increase, and debt decrease.

The vulnerability lies in the following parts of the function:
a. The calculation of `assetsFromIdle`: The line `assetsFromIdle = assets >= idle ? idle : assets;` computes `assetsFromIdle` based on whether `assets` is greater than or `equal` to `idle`. If assets is smaller than `idle`, it will be set to `assets`, potentially leading to an underflow when `assets` is zero.
b. The calculation of `totalAssetsToPull`: The line `totalAssetsToPull = assets - (assets >= idle ? idle : assets);` calculates `totalAssetsToPull` as the difference between `assets` and `assetsFromIdle`. If `assets` is less than `idle`, this subtraction can also lead to an underflow when `assets` is zero.
## Impact
If an underflow occurs during the withdrawal process, it can lead to incorrect asset calculations and unexpected behavior. For example, the contract might withdraw more assets than intended, resulting in financial losses for users.
