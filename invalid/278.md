# _processWethOut allows user to withdraw the whole WETH balance from LMPVaultRouterBase contract
## Summary
The _processWethOut function in the LMPVaultRouterBase contract allows any user to withdraw the entire WETH balance from the contract. This vulnerability is triggered when either the redeem or withdraw functions are called with the unwrapWETH parameter set to true.

## Vulnerability Detail
The LMPVaultRouterBase contract sometimes holds WETH balances of other users, which are provided when they call the deposit and mint functions. The _processWethOut function, when invoked, allows the withdrawal of the entire WETH balance from the contract, irrespective of the amount the caller is entitled to. This means that a malicious actor could deposit a small amount, then immediately call withdraw or redeem with unwrapWETH set to true, and potentially drain all the WETH from the contract.

## Impact
This vulnerability can be easily exploited. The entire contract becomes vulnerable as its normal usage pattern can lead to unintended consequences, allowing malicious actors to drain funds by mempool monitoring.


## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L124-L131
```solidity
    function _processWethOut(address to) internal {
        uint256 balanceWETH9 = weth9.balanceOf(address(this));

        if (balanceWETH9 > 0) {
            weth9.withdraw(balanceWETH9);
            Address.sendValue(payable(to), balanceWETH9);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the _processWethOut function to accept an additional parameter specifying the amount of WETH to be withdrawn. This will ensure that only the intended amount is sent to the function caller, preventing the entire balance from being drained.

```solidity
function _processWethOut(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    require(amount <= weth9.balanceOf(address(this)), "Insufficient WETH balance");

    if (amount > 0) {
        weth9.withdraw(amount);
        Address.sendValue(payable(to), amount);
    }
}
```

Then modify withdraw and redeem functions logic to properly calculate the amount that should be processed out.

```solidity

function withdraw(
    ILMPVault vault,
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 maxSharesOut,
    bool unwrapWETH
) public virtual override returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
    address destination = unwrapWETH ? address(this) : to;

    sharesOut = vault.withdraw(amount, destination, msg.sender);
    if (sharesOut > maxSharesOut) {
        revert MaxSharesError();
    }

    if (unwrapWETH) {
        _processWethOut(to, amount);
    }
}

function redeem(
    ILMPVault vault,
    address to,
    uint256 shares,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    bool unwrapWETH
) public virtual override returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    address destination = unwrapWETH ? address(this) : to;

    amountOut = vault.redeem(shares, destination, msg.sender);
    if (amountOut < minAmountOut) {
        revert MinAmountError();
    }

    if (unwrapWETH) {
        _processWethOut(to, amountOut);
    }
}

```
