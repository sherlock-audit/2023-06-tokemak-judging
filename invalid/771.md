# Unable to initialize BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol
## Summary

When calling the BalancerAuraDestinationVault.initialize() function (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/BalancerAuraDestinationVault .sol#L79-L115) is called

super.initialize(baseAsset_, underlyer_, rewarder_, additionalTrackedTokens_, params_); (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol#L88)

contract DestinationVault.sol.

However, by the time BalancerAuraDestinationVault.initialize() is called, the DestinationVault.sol contract has already been initialized. The DestinationVault.sol contract is initialized when the contract is deployed in DestinationVaultFactory.sol (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/ src/vault/DestinationVaultFactory.sol#L90-L92):

IDestinationVault(vault).initialize(
     IERC20(baseAsset), IERC20(underlyer), mainRewarder, additionalTrackedTokens, params
);

This will make it impossible to initialize the BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol contract, because the line super.initialize(baseAsset_, underlyer_, rewarder_, additionalTrackedTokens_, params_) will produce a revert.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if the super.initialize contract has been initialized. Add an initializer modifier.
