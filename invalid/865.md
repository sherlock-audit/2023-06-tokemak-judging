# No minAnswer/maxAnswer Circuit Breaker Checks while Querying Prices in chainlink oracle.
## Summary

 Chainlink oracles  have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. As such, if an asset experiences a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash) the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset.  This could potentially lead to an exploitation scenario where the protocol interacts with the asset using incorrect price information.

## Vulnerability Detail
  }

    // slither-disable-start timestamp
    function getPriceInEth(address token) external returns (uint256) {
        ChainlinkInfo memory chainlinkOracle = _getChainlinkInfo(token);

        // Partial return values are intentionally ignored. This call provides the most efficient way to get the data.
        // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
        (uint80 roundId, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = chainlinkOracle.oracle.latestRoundData();
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint256 oracleStoredTimeout = uint256(chainlinkOracle.pricingTimeout);
        uint256 tokenPricingTimeout = oracleStoredTimeout == 0 ? DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT : oracleStoredTimeout;
        if (
            roundId == 0 || price <= 0 || updatedAt == 0 || updatedAt > timestamp
                || updatedAt < timestamp - tokenPricingTimeout
        ) revert InvalidDataReturned();


As we can see this function  retrieves the latest round data from Chainlink  and checks that the price > 0 .However, it doesn't check for min/max  in the event that an asset's market price falls below minAnswer or is above maxAnswer, the returned price would still be minAnswer or maxAnswer, respectively, instead of the actual market price.  

   Example

1. current price of a tokenX is $20
2. TokenX has a minimum price set at $1 on chainlink
3. The actual price of TokenX dips to $0.10
4. The oracle continues to report $1 as the price.
 
 Due to this the protocol will continue to interact with tokenX  as if it was still valued at $1

## Recommendation
consider check that the price returned is within the min/max bounds and if not revert the transaction as recommended by chainlink.https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds#market-failures-resulting-from-extreme-events
