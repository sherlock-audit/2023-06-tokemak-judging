# Major losses for users if `redeem()` is called in between `rebalance()` and `setWithdrawalQueue()`
## Summary
A user takes a major loss if a `redeem()` call is sent in between a migration from one destination vault to another.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [`rebalance()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L691) function sends the funds from one destination vault to another (the exact strategy depends on the implementation, but it's [not available in the current codebase](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/strategy/LMPStrategy.sol#L9)).

[`redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L422) withdraws tokens from the destination vaults in the withdrawal queue, offering no slippage protection. If not enough funds are retrieved from destination vaults and there is not enough idle available, the user takes this loss.

[`setWithdrawalQueue()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L661) sets the withdrawal queue from which the assets are withdrawn when calling `redeem()` or [`withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L400) and there is not enough idle.

Note that the `rebalance()` and `setWithdrawalQueue()` functions are done by different roles, `SOLVER_ROLE` and `SET_WITHDRAWAL_QUEUE_ROLE`, respectively.

Given these 4 points, there is the possibility that a user withdrawal using `redeem()` is caught in between a migration from one destination vault to another, where the `rebalance()` and `setWithdrawalQueue()` functions are not atomic (different roles might make it impossible to be atomic, but even then these transactions could be sent seperately, as there is no indication otherwise).

Consider the following scenario (other variations of it trigger the same issue):
1. `rebalance()` transaction sending funds from destination vault A to destination vault B.
2. `setWithdrawalQueue()` transaction changing the withdrawal queue from destination vault A to destination vault B.
3. `redeem()` transaction of a user.

The outcome of these 3 transactions depends greatly on their order. If 1 and 2 arrive before 3, there is no problem. However, if the order is 1 - 3 - 2 or 2 - 3 - 1, the user will take a massive loss.

## Impact
User takes a massive loss (amount depends on the details of the race condition).

## Code Snippet
The scenario above was replicated in a test in `LMPVault-Withdrawa.t.sol` as a POC:
```solidity
function test_POC_UserMassiveLoss_RebalanceAndSetWithdrawalQueue_RaceConditions() public {
    _accessController.grantRole(Roles.SOLVER_ROLE, address(this));
    _accessController.grantRole(Roles.LMP_FEE_SETTER_ROLE, address(this));

    // Only vault A is in withdrawal queue
    address[] memory withdrawalQueue_ = new address[](1);
    withdrawalQueue_[0] = address(_destVaultOne);
    _lmpVault.setWithdrawalQueue(withdrawalQueue_);

    // User is going to deposit 1000 asset
    _asset.mint(address(this), 1000);
    _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);
    _lmpVault.deposit(1000, address(this));

    // Deployed 500 asset to DV1
    _underlyerOne.mint(address(this), 500);
    _underlyerOne.approve(address(_lmpVault), 500);
    _lmpVault.rebalance(
        address(_destVaultOne),
        address(_underlyerOne), // tokenIn
        500,
        address(0), // destinationOut, none when sending out baseAsset
        address(_asset), // baseAsset, tokenOut
        1000
    );

    // rebalancer wants to move all funds to destination vault 2
    // set withdrawal queue role is told to change the withdrawal queue to vault 2

    // Deploy 1000 asset to DV2 and remove assets from DV1
    _underlyerTwo.mint(address(this), 1000);
    _underlyerTwo.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);
    _lmpVault.rebalance(
        address(_destVaultTwo),
        address(_underlyerTwo), // tokenIn
        1000,
        address(_destVaultOne), // destinationOut, none when sending out baseAsset
        address(_underlyerOne), // baseAsset, tokenOut
        500
    );

    // User redeems before the set withdrawal queue transaction

    uint256 balBefore = _asset.balanceOf(address(this));
    vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
    emit Withdraw(address(this), address(this), address(this), 0, 1000);
    uint256 assets = _lmpVault.redeem(1000, address(this), address(this));
    uint256 balAfter = _asset.balanceOf(address(this));

    assertEq(assets, 0, "returned");
    assertEq(balAfter - balBefore, 0, "actual");

    // set withdrawal queue transaction arrives later
    withdrawalQueue_[0] = address(_destVaultTwo);
    _lmpVault.setWithdrawalQueue(withdrawalQueue_);
}
```

## Recommendation
The rebalance call already verifies the validity of the rebalance in `LMPStrategy.verifyRebalance(params);` of [`rebalance()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L89) and [`flashRebalance()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L163), ensuring no loss for the users (as stated in the scope). Although the code implementation is not available yet ([`TODO`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/strategy/LMPStrategy.sol#L12)), it is suggested to include a check to ensure that after rebalancing, a minimum threshold (as a parameter, or hardcoded) of debt available to withdraw with the current withdrawal queue is available.

A similar check should be added to `setWithdrawalQueue()` to prevent setting a withdrawal queue that would make users take big losses. An argument `minimumDebtPercentage` could be provided that would calculate the total debt of the new withdrawal queue destination vaults and revert if it is lower than the threshold.

These 2 mitigations would prevent race conditions such as the one described in this issue.
