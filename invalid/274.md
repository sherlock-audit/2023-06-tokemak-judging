# Rely On Oracle Which Are Not Updated Frequently
## Summary
The vault relies on Balancer Oracle which is not updated frequently. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The Balancer pool that will be polled for the pair price can be found at https://etherscan.io/address/0x32296969Ef14EB0c6d29669C550D4a0449130230.

The price will only be updated whenever a transaction (e.g. swap) within the Balancer pool is triggered. Due to the lack of updates, the price provided by Balancer Oracle will not reflect the true value of the assets. Considering the stETH/ETH Balancer pool, the price  provided will not reflect the true value in the market

This problem is also present with a curve oracle.
## Impact
The price provided by the oracle will not reflect the true value of the assets. It might be overvalued or undervalued.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Choose and use a more accurate Oracle that is updated more frequently instead of using the Balancer Oracle that is infrequently updated.
