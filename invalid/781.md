# 'removeLiquidity' in `BalancerBeethovenAdapter` does not manage slippage control correctly
## Summary

'removeLiquidity' in `BalancerBeethovenAdapter` does not manage slippage control correctly. which can result loss of funds and unwanted trades

## Vulnerability Detail
FLOW
`removeLiquidity` used for getting `exact number of tokens withdrawn from pool` by  maximum `maxLpBurnAmount` amount of LP tokens burning.
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Withdraw liquidity from Balancer or Beethoven pool
     * @dev Calls into external contract. Should be guarded with
     * non-reentrant flags in a used contract
     * @param vault Balancer Vault contract
     * @param pool Balancer or Beethoven Pool to withdrawn liquidity from
     * @param tokens Addresses of tokens to withdraw. Should match pool tokens
     * @param exactAmountsOut Array of exact amounts of tokens to be withdrawn from pool
     * @param maxLpBurnAmount Max amount of LP tokens to burn in the withdrawal
     */
    function removeLiquidity(
        IVault vault,
        address pool,
        address[] calldata tokens,
        uint256[] calldata exactAmountsOut,
        uint256 maxLpBurnAmount
    ) public returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts) {

     bytes memory userData;
        if (BalancerUtilities.isComposablePool(pool)) {
            userData = abi.encode(ExitKindComposable.EXACT_BPT_IN_FOR_ALL_TOKENS_OUT, maxLpBurnAmount);
        } else {
            userData = abi.encode(ExitKind.BPT_IN_FOR_EXACT_TOKENS_OUT, exactAmountsOut, maxLpBurnAmount);
        }

From the documentation of Balancer EXIT POOLS

 `EXACT_BPT_IN_FOR_ALL_TOKENS_OUT` - User sends a precise quantity of BPT, and receives an estimated but unknown (computed at run time) quantities of all tokens

`BPT_IN_FOR_EXACT_TOKENS_OUT`- User sends an estimated but unknown (computed at run time) quantity of BPT, and receives precise quantities of specified tokens


`PURPOSE of removeliquidity   function`-  We need exact number of token withdrawn by burning LP token but Lp token burnt should be less or equal to `maxLpBurnAmount` 

but `EXACT_BPT_IN_FOR_ALL_TOKENS_OUT` will burn `maxLpBurnAmount` LP tokens and mint unknown quantities of all tokens then we are making sure at line [337](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/destinations/adapters/BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol#L337) and [326](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/destinations/adapters/BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol#L326) if we are getting more than or equal tokens and buring amount otherwise revert 
```solidity
326 if (bptBalanceAfter >= bptBalanceBefore) {
            revert InvalidBalanceChange();
        }
337 if (currentBalance < assetBalanceBefore + amountsOut[i]) {
                    revert BalanceMustIncrease();
                }
```
but neither of this was our purpose - we were expecting exact number of tokens by not burning given maxLPToken 
as final output we need `bptBalanceAfter <= bptBalanceBefore +maxLpBurnAmount &&  currentBalance ==assetBalanceBefore +amountsOut[i]` which is not done here

Also for `BPT_IN_FOR_EXACT_TOKENS_OUT`  similar not proper check has been implemented to control slippage 


## Impact

Incorrect slippage control in `removeLiquidity`

## Code Snippet

see above 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

depending upon `BPT_IN_FOR_EXACT_TOKENS_OUT` and `EXACT_BPT_IN_FOR_ALL_TOKENS_OUT` do the needful check to make sure that our purpose of `removeLiquidity` is followed and also including a deadline parameter will be better
