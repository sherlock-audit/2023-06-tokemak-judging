# BaseAsyncSwapper.sol does not allow for any slippage on swap
## Summary
99% of swaps baseAsyncSwapper performs through typical AMM's will fail due to no slippage/price impact allowance. 

## Vulnerability Detail
baseAsyncSwapper is expecting the actual amount of token returned from a swap to be exactly equal to swapParams.buyAmount, and does not take slippage/price impact into account.
## Impact
The vast majority of swaps performed through this swapper will fail unless someones invented an on chain AMM guarenteeing no slippage/price impact on any trade including non pegged assets.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Account for slippage/price impact in some way, which for most aggregators/dexes should be included in swap params and thus should be checked for you through their router, but code in its current state will revert unless 0% slippage 0% price impact trade is achieved.
