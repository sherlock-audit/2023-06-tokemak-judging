# Inadequate Handling of Non-Standard ERC-20 Token Approvals in `removeLiquidity` function
## Summary
 Tokens like Tether (USDT) utilize a distinct behavior in their `approve()` function that reverts if the current approval is not zero. This measure is intended to counteract the potential front-running of approval changes. 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function removeLiquidity(
    IRouter router,
    uint256[] calldata amounts,
    uint256 maxLpBurnAmount,
    bytes calldata extraParams
) external returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts) {
    // ... (other code)

    router.position().approve(address(router), maverickExtraParams.tokenId);

    // ... (other code)
}
```
In this code snippet, the approve() function is used without accounting for tokens like USDT. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds when interacting with such tokens.
## Impact
The consequence of this oversight is that tokens with non-standard `approve()` behavior, like USDT, might not function as expected when used as part of the project. This would limit the project's potential.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it's recommended to use OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library's `safeTransfer()` function instead of directly invoking the `approve()` function. By utilizing `safeTransfer()`, the codebase can ensure standardized handling of token transfers and approvals, effectively mitigating the issue with non-standard ERC-20 tokens. This will help maintain the desired functionality of the tokens, even when their `approve()` behavior deviates from the standard.
