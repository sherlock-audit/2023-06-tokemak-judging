# The receive() fallback function in GPToke.sol is not written as intended
## Summary

The receive() function in GPToke.sol intends to take in ETH, wrap to WETH, and deposit into the GPToken contract. However, the WETH amount is still in the caller's contract, and not GPToke contract, so calling GPToke.addWETHRewards() will result in GPToke contract depositing into itself.

## Vulnerability Detail

In GPToke.sol, there is a receive() function. This receive() function intends to take any ETH sent into the contract as reward tokens. Firstly, it calls weth.deposit to change the ETH to WETH. Then, it calls GPToke.addWETHRewards() to call the addWETHRewards function.

```solidity
    receive() external payable {
        // appreciate the ETH! wrap and add as rewards
        weth.deposit{ value: msg.value }();
->      GPToke(payable(this)).addWETHRewards(msg.value);
    }
```
```solidity
    function addWETHRewards(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(amount, "amount");


        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        Errors.verifyNotZero(supply, "supply");


        totalRewardsEarned += amount;
        accRewardPerShare += amount * REWARD_FACTOR / supply;


        emit RewardsAdded(amount);


->      weth.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```
When a contract A directly deposits ETH into GPToke, the msg.sender in receive() is contract A. After calling weth deposit, the amount of WETH is in contract A. However, GPToke.addWETHRewards is called, changing the msg.sender from contract A to GPToke contract address. When addWETHRewards is called, the msg.sender is now GPToke instead of contract A. The function attempts to transfer weth from msg.sender (GPToke Contract) to address(this) (GPTokeContract), which is incorrect.

## Impact

GPToke will deposit its own WETH into the contract, which does not make sense

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Don't change the msg.sender. In fact, if the protocol intends to have another route to transfer WETH into the contract, it is best to simply create a new function instead of merging functions together. Recommend adding the addWETHRewards function directly into the receive() callback.

```solidity
    receive() external payable {
        // appreciate the ETH! wrap and add as rewards
        weth.deposit{ value: msg.value }();
        Errors.verifyNotZero(amount, "amount");

        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        Errors.verifyNotZero(supply, "supply");

        totalRewardsEarned += amount;
        accRewardPerShare += amount * REWARD_FACTOR / supply;

        emit RewardsAdded(amount);

        weth.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```
