# Lost funds in `LiquidationRow` if `swapParams.sellAmount` is less than `totalBalanceToLiquidate`
## Summary
Funds are permanently lost when `swapParams.sellAmount` is different than the sum of the vault balances when `liquidateVaultsForToken()` is called. It's likely a significant amount of lost funds build over time if `liquidateVaultsForToken()` is called right after `claimsVaultRewards()`, as a few blocks could have progressed until the transactions are included, leading to extra rewards not accounted for in the `swapParams()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
[`LiquidationRow:liquidateVaultsForToken()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L167) swaps the [`sellAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L251) specified in `swapParams` without taking into account the [`totalBalanceToLiquidate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L246) from stored vault balances. Disregarding obvious admin mistake, it's possible that the amounts mismatch even if behaving correctly, as shown in the following example:

Offchain, an earned reward of **n** is fetched from the rewarder contracts.
Then the following 2 transactions are sent (probably atomically to optimize gas, but could be separate anyway):
- [`claimVaultRewards()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/liquidation/LiquidationRow.sol#L104)
- `liquidateVaultsForToken()`, with a `swapParams.sellAmount` of **n**, as fetched offchain prior to the call.

It's likely that the transactions are not included in the block in which the rewards were fetched. Given that the rewards in the rewarders of the `Convex`, `Balancer` or `Maverick` pools accrue over time, based on the timestamp, tokens will be lost due to the fetched offchain reward amount (set in `sellParams.sellAmount`) being less than the actual claimed rewards.

Add the following test to `LiquidationRow.t.sol` as a POC:
```solidity
function test_POC_SwapLessThanBalance_StillWipesBalance() public {
    liquidationRow.addToWhitelist(address(asyncSwapper));

    _mockComplexScenario(address(testVault));
    IDestinationVault[] memory vaults = _initArrayOfOneTestVault();
    liquidationRow.claimsVaultRewards(vaults);

    SwapParams memory swapParams =
        SwapParams(address(rewardToken2), 195, address(targetToken), 195, new bytes(0), new bytes(0));

    liquidationRow.liquidateVaultsForToken(address(rewardToken2), address(asyncSwapper), vaults, swapParams);

    assertTrue(liquidationRow.balanceOf(address(rewardToken), address(testVault)) == 100);
    assertTrue(liquidationRow.balanceOf(address(rewardToken2), address(testVault)) == 0);
    assertTrue(liquidationRow.balanceOf(address(rewardToken3), address(testVault)) == 100);
    assertTrue(liquidationRow.balanceOf(address(rewardToken4), address(testVault)) == 100);
    assertTrue(liquidationRow.balanceOf(address(rewardToken5), address(testVault)) == 100);

    assertTrue(liquidationRow.totalBalanceOf(address(rewardToken)) == 100);
    assertTrue(liquidationRow.totalBalanceOf(address(rewardToken2)) == 0);
    assertTrue(liquidationRow.totalBalanceOf(address(rewardToken3)) == 100);
    assertTrue(liquidationRow.totalBalanceOf(address(rewardToken4)) == 100);
    assertTrue(liquidationRow.totalBalanceOf(address(rewardToken5)) == 100);
}
```
`sellParams.sellAmount` differs from the actual balance, but the liquidation is carried out anyway, leading to stuck tokens in the contract. The balance of the liquidated vault is set to 0, preventing them from being recovered.

## Impact
Over time increasing loss of funds, permanently stuck in `LiquidationRow`. It's possible to mitigate this by only calling `liquidateVaultsForToken()` after the `claimVaultRewards()` transaction has fully settled, but it might not always be the case.
