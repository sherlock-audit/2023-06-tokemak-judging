# LMPVault._ensureNoNavDecrease()/LMPVault._ensureNoNavChange() will not work when totalSupply() >= totalAssets() * 100
## Summary

`LMPVault._ensureNoNavDecrease()`/`LMPVault._ensureNoNavChange()` will not work when `totalSupply() >= totalAssets() * 100`. Consequently, this vulnerability can result in the failure of the `noNavChange` and `noNavDecrease` modifiers.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_ensureNoNavDecrease()`,`_ensureNoNavChange()` functions and `noNavChange()`,`noNavDecrease()` modifiers are designed to ensure that the NAV does not change or decrease by a significant margin. The vulnerability arises from the following conditions:

1. The `oldNav` argument, taken from the `_snapStartNav()` function, is used in `_ensureNoNavDecrease()` and `_ensureNoNavChange()`.
2. When `totalSupply() >= totalAssets() * 100`, then `oldNav <= 100`.
3.  When `oldNav <= 100`, in the `_ensureNoNavDecrease()` and `_ensureNoNavChange()` functions, the `lowerBound = 0`.
4. When `lowerBound = 0`, these functions will not trigger a revert even if the NAV decreases or changes, because `newNav < lowerBound` will always hold true. 
This results in  `_ensureNoNavDecrease()`,`_ensureNoNavChange()` functions and `noNavChange()`,`noNavDecrease()` modifiers stop working.

## Impact

This vulnerability can cause above-mentioned functions, along with their related modifiers, to stop working. This can lead to unintended behaviour for functions that apply `noNavChange` and `noNavDecrease` modifiers.
