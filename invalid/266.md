# Critical: Security issue using block.timestamp
## Summary
block.timestamp can be manipulated

## Vulnerability Detail
When the contract uses the timestamp to seed a random number, the miner can actually post a timestamp within 15 seconds of the block being validated, effectively allowing the miner to precompute an option more favorable to their chances in the lottery. Timestamps are not random and should not be used in that context.

```solidity
lastSnapshotTimestamp = block.timestamp;
``` 
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
uint256 public start;
 function startTimer() public {
        start = block.timestamp;
    }

    function checkTime() public view returns (bool) {
        return (block.timestamp >= (start + 15));
    }
lastSnapshotTimestamp = checkTime();
```
