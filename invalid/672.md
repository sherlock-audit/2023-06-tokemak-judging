# Read-only reentrancy checking for Curve related Oracle may not work
## Summary

The oracle contract assumes that all Curve Pool contracts have the same interface and function for withdrawing admin fees, which may not be true and cause the contract to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

When getting the price from Curve Pool, the oracle contract will prevent the read-only reentrancy by calling the `withdraw_admin_fees` function of the Curve Pool contract.

        if (iToken == LibAdapter.CURVE_REGISTRY_ETH_ADDRESS_POINTER) {
            if (poolInfo.checkReentrancy == 1) {
                // This will fail in reentrancy
                ICurveOwner(pool.owner()).withdraw_admin_fees(address(pool));
            }
        }

        // Checking for read only reentrancy scenario.
        if (poolInfo.checkReentrancy == 1) {
            // This will fail in a reentrancy situation.
            cryptoPool.claim_admin_fees();
        }

However, not all the Curve Pool contracts have the same interface and function for `withdrawing` admin fees. For example:

- In this STETH_ETH_CURVE_POOL pool, the `withdraw_admin_fees` can only be called by the admin: https://etherscan.io/address/0xdc24316b9ae028f1497c275eb9192a3ea0f67022#code
- In this TRICRYPTO_MAINNET pool, the `withdraw_admin_fees` does not exist, but there is a `claim_admin_fees` function: https://etherscan.io/address/0xd51a44d3fae010294c616388b506acda1bfaae46#code

This means that the read-only reentrancy checking may not work as expected for some Curve Pool contracts and cause the Curve related Oracle to break.

## Impact

The read-only reentrancy checking may not work and cause the Oracle to break. It affects all the operations of the protocol that rely on the oracle.
