# Vault does not conform to ERC4626
## Summary
Vault does not conform to ERC4626

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact
The [ERC4626 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) states that `maxDeposit`

> MUST return the maximum amount of assets deposit would allow to be deposited for receiver and not cause a revert, which MUST NOT be higher than the actual maximum that would be accepted

Similarly, `maxMint`

> MUST return the maximum amount of shares mint would allow to be deposited to receiver and not cause a revert, which MUST NOT be higher than the actual maximum that would be accepted......

These compliance seems to be missing in current implementation.
