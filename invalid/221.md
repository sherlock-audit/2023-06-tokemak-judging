# CurveV2FactoryCryptoAdapter's `addLiquidity` may use incorrect ETH amount (for pools that ETH is not at index 0), leading to tx reverts.
## Summary
CurveV2FactoryCryptoAdapter's `addLiquidity` may use incorrect ETH amount to supply to the pool  (for pools that ETH is not at index 0). For example, the tri-crypto swap pool https://etherscan.io/address/0xd51a44d3fae010294c616388b506acda1bfaae46 , where ETH is at index 2 (not 0).

## Impact
- If supplied ETH amount is too low than actual (in token amounts in the correct ETH index), then the tx will revert due to slippage control (supplied value too low).
- If supplied ETH amount is too high than actual (in token amounts in the correct ETH index), then the tx will likely revert due to insufficient ETH in the contract that calls the `add_liquidity` function.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Do not fix the ETH index to be 0. Can just search for which index is ETH and use that as the value.
