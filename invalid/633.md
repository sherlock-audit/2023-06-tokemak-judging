# In LMPVault.sol, First deposit exploit can break share calculation
## Summary
In LMPVault.sol, First deposit exploit can break share calculation

## Vulnerability Detail
LMPVault.sol is an 4626 compatible vault. It has used openzeppelin ERC4626 contract in its implementation. ERC4626, an extension of ERC20, is a standard that is mostly used in yield-bearing tokens. The contract of an ERC4626 token itself is an ERC20 which serves as a "shares" token and has an underlying asset which is another ERC20. The idea behind this is in such a way that the users deposit their assets and get corresponding shares. The function convertToShares() is responsible to return the corresponding share of a user with respect to his deposited assets.

```Solidity

    function _convertToShares(uint256 assets, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        return
            (assets == 0 || supply == 0)
                ? _initialConvertToShares(assets, rounding)
                : assets.mulDiv(supply, totalAssets(), rounding);
    }
```

One of the main problems with these tokens lies in the fact that the first depositor can manipulate the unit share price in a bad way. The ratio of `totalSupply/totalAssets` determines the corresponding share of a deposited asset. As it is clear from the ratio if the first user deposits 1 Wei, will get 1 Wei worth of share. Now consider a scenario with the preceding steps:

1 - The same bad guy deposits $\large 10000 \times 10 ^ {18} - 1 $ amount of underlying assets.
2 - As a consequence, the abovementioned ratio skyrockets and won't be a 1:1 pair anymore.
3 - The later users who deposit large amounts of assets (e.g. 9999 X 10 ^ 18 - 1) will get 1 Wei worth of shares.
4 - Thus, if they call redeem() after depositing, they will immediately lose $\large 9999 \times 10 ^ {18} - 1 $ (nearly half of) the assets.

## Impact
Unit price share manipulation of the first user can lead to fund loss of the later depositors in yield-bearing tokens such as ERC4626.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider requiring a minimal amount of share tokens to be minted for the first minter to prevent such manipulations.

It is to be noted here that openzeppelin has fixed ERC4626 inflation attack issue in their latest version. Reference [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.9.0), However Tokemak contracts have used old openzeppelin version i.e 4.8.1 which is confirmed from [lib...package.json](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/0457042d93d9dfd760dbaa06a4d2f1216fdbe297/package.json#L4). It is also recocommended to update the OZ to latest version.
