# All of the calls done to `MainRewarder.sol` should be done trough a proxy `StakeTracking` which is not the case
## Summary
It is stated in the documentation that `StakeTracking` is used to keep track of the total supply and balance of tokens staked by users in Vaults and it should be used as a proxy between Vaults and the MainRewarder contract 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/README.md
but that is not the case in any of the Vaults.
## Vulnerability Detail
As can be seen there are multiple instances in the Vaults contracts where it interacts with the `MainRewarder` contract like
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L341
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L351
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L541
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L844
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L863
and every interaction it is done directly to the MainRewarder contract and not the StakeTracking proxy one. Because of that most the functionality in the MainRewarder contract would revert since it uses modifiers like `onlyStakeTracker` across its functionality 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L73
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L86
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L101
There is no instance of the `StakeTracking` and the interface is quite simple 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/interfaces/rewarders/IStakeTracking.sol#L1-L7
and since it is specified that it should be used as the proxy contract between those two, the way the implementation is done right now, doesn't respect the documentation which would make most of the MainRewarder functionality unusable.
## Impact
Impact is a medium one because no an important functionality of the protocol would not work.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
All of the calls done in the Vaults should be done trough the proxy `StakeTracking` specified in the documentation and not directly to the MainRewarder contract.
