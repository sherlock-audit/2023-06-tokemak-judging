## Summary

Need for Measure Access Control Management for this function

## Vulnerability Detail
The incorporation of access control within vital functions is essential to deter unauthorized access and potential manipulation by harmful entities.

## Impact
Malicious attacks based on user defined input parameters are allowed in this function

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function addDestinations(
        EnumerableSet.AddressSet storage removalQueue,
        EnumerableSet.AddressSet storage destinations,
        address[] calldata _destinations,
        ISystemRegistry systemRegistry
    ) external {
        IDestinationVaultRegistry destinationRegistry = systemRegistry.destinationVaultRegistry();

        uint256 numDestinations = _destinations.length;
        if (numDestinations == 0) revert Errors.InvalidParams();
```
