# Access Control or User defined address input
## Summary
Add Proper Access Control or Remove User defined address input

## Vulnerability Detail
It is imperative to implement robust access control measures to protect against detrimental inputs to the user-defined contract address gauge. Furthermore, the check-effect-interaction pattern should be correctly applied. Failure to adhere to these protocols may render the system susceptible to threats from malicious contracts. Such vulnerability could potentially result in the exploitation of the getReward function, inaccurate reporting of claimed tokens, and unauthorized transfer of claimed tokens prior to their return.

## Impact
Malicious attack based on user defined input parameters allowed in this function

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardsLength; ++i) {
            RewardType memory rewardType = rewardPool.rewards(i);
            IERC20 token = IERC20(rewardType.reward_token);
            rewardTokens[i] = token;
            balancesBefore[i] = token.balanceOf(account);
        }
        // TODO: Check if it mints CVX by default

        // claim rewards
        rewardPool.getReward(account);

        // get balances after and calculate amounts claimed
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardsLength; ++i) {
            uint256 balance = rewardTokens[i].balanceOf(account);
            amountsClaimed[i] = balance - balancesBefore[i];
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is imperative to enforce stringent access control or consider eliminating the user-defined external contract address for this function. This suggestion stems from the potential susceptibility to manipulation via the `rewardPool.getReward(account);` function.
