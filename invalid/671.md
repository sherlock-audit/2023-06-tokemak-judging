# Chainlink Oracle contract will break if the decimal of the priceFeed is more than 18
## Summary

The oracle contract does not handle the case when the priceFeed returns a value with more than 18 decimals, which will cause the contract to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `getPriceInEth` function, after getting the price from the Chainlink Oracle, it tries to normalize the price to 18 decimals. The function handles the case when the decimals is less than 18 by multiplying the price by 10 to the power of (18 - decimals).

        uint256 normalizedPrice = decimals == 18 ? priceUint : priceUint * 10 ** (18 - decimals);

However, the case when the returned decimals is more than 18 is not handled. In this case, the function will always revert because of an overflow error and the oracle contract will break.

## Impact

The Chainlink Oracle will be unusable and the price will not be returned. It affects all the operations of the protocol that rely on the oracle.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Handle the case when the decimals is more than 18 by dividing the price by 10 to the power of (decimals - 18). For example, if the decimals is 19, then the price should be divided by 10.
