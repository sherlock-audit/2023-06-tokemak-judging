# Tokens with less than 18 decimals will cause loss to buyer/seller
## Summary
The BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol, CurveV2FactoryCryptoAdapter.sol and MaverickAdapter.sol allows to supply assets which can then be buy or sell by providing collateral by other users in a peer-to-peer fashion without considering difference in decimals. 
	
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol does not take into account tokens with 18 decimals and assumes that all tokens added on a pool creation i.e. both sellToken and buyToken have 18 decimal spots. This is not the case for many major tokens which can be expected to be either added as liquidity like WBTC (8 decimals), USDC (6 decimals) etc. This lack of accountability allows an attacker to drain the funds supplied by the user who set the pool with a minimum investment. 

## Impact
Any pools which have a loan token with less than 18 decimals can be drained with almost insignificant collateral provided.
This issue is bi-directional as a pair where the buyToken has 18 decimals and the sellToken has less than 18 decimals also breaks the core logic of the protocol by producing an extremely high ratio of loss.

## Tool used

Manual code Review

## Recommendation
Make sure to scale collateral based on the token decimals in order to calculate properly the ratio. This can be easily done by changing the calculation as follows:
uint256 Ratio = ((buyAmount * (10**(18 - buyToken.decimals()))) * 10 ** 18) / (sellAmount * (10 ** (18 - sellToken.decimals())));
