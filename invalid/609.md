# The balance of the pools can be manipulated when exiting liquidity
## Summary

A malicious user could manipulate the reserves of the pools and cause the pool to be imbalanced, resulting in losses to the vault and its users and allowing malicious users to reap the benefits from this situation.

## Vulnerability Detail

Assume the following scenario:

- One WETH LMPVault with two DVs. 
- One is a Balancer's DV called $DV_{bal}$ and another is a Curve's DV called $DV_{cur}$. The withdrawal queue is configured in this sequence $[DV_{bal}, DV_{cur}]$.
- $DV_{bal}$ interacts with a Balancer pool called $Pool_{bal-xy}$ that consists of two tokens, namely $Token_x$ and $Token_y$.
- The DVs are profitable. Thus, there are no restrictions on the withdrawal. Anyone can burn all the DV shares in one go.
- WETH LMPVault's `totalIdle` is zero and `totalDebt` is 200 WETH. 100 WETH has been allocated to both $DV_{bal}$ and $DV_{cur}$.
- $DV_{bal}$ has 100 $Pool_{bal-xy}$ LP Token. For simplicity's sake, assume the following:
  - 1 $Pool_{bal-xy}$ LP Token is worth 1 ETH
  - The pool allocation is 50% $Token_a$ and 50% $Token_b$
  - 1 $Token_a$:1 $Token_b$.
- One $DV_{bal}$ share is equal to one $Pool_{bal-xy}$ LP Token (1:1)

Assume that a user attempts to withdraw 50 WETH of assets from the LMPVault (`assets = 50 WETH`). Since the LMPVault's `totalIdle` is zero, `totalAssetsToPull` will be the entire withdrawal amount of 50 WETH, meaning all amounts must be obtained from the DVs.

The code will attempt to exit the liquidity proportionally from Balancer's $Pool_{bal-xy}$. If there is no manipulation, a proportional amount (50%:50%) of 25 $Token_{a}$ and 25 $Token_b$ will be returned.

However, a malicious user could manipulate the reserve of the pools and cause the pool to be extremely imbalanced. Assume that after the manipulation, the pool becomes (80%:20%). Thus, 40 $Token_a$ and 10 $Token_b$ are returned instead.

This will lead to several issues that could negatively affect the vaults and their users. Following are some of the potential impacts:

1) If $Token_a$ have a lower liquidity than $Token_b$ in the overall market, the cost of swapping $Token_a$ to base asset (WETH) will be higher compared to the cost of swapping $Token_b$ to base asset. As a result, LMPVault will end up incurring more losses due to the additional costs, which lead to lower profit for the vault shareholders
2) Malicious users might have a stake in the pool that is used to swap $Token_{a}$ to base asset. Thus, they are incentivized to route as many $Token_a$ as possible to that pool for their benefits at the expense of the losses of Tokemak's users.

After exiting the liquidity from $DV_{bal}$, if it still does not meet the targeted amount of 50 WETH, the code will move on to the $DV_{cur}$ to withdraw the remaining amount to ensure that 50 WETH is returned to the users at the end.

When exiting the liquidity in the above scenario, the `DestinationVault.withdrawBaseAsset` function is triggered. It will call the `DestinationVault._burnUnderlyer` function to burn the underlying (LP Token) to perform a proportional exit to obtain the pool tokens.

For the `CurveConvexDestinationVault._burnUnderlyer` function, the `minAmounts` is set to `[0,0]`, which means any amount of tokens returned from removing the liquidity is acceptable.

```solidity
File: CurveConvexDestinationVault.sol
183:     function _burnUnderlyer(uint256 underlyerAmount)
184:         internal
185:         virtual
186:         override
187:         returns (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts)
188:     {
189:         // We withdraw everything in one coin to ease swapping
190:         // re: minAmount == 0, this call is only made during a user initiated withdraw where slippage is
191:         // controlled for at the router
192: 
193:         // We always want our tokens back in WETH so useEth false
194:         (tokens, amounts) = CurveV2FactoryCryptoAdapter.removeLiquidity(
195:             minAmounts, underlyerAmount, curvePool, curveLpToken, IWETH9(_systemRegistry.weth())
196:         );
197:     }
```

The same goes for the  `BalancerAuraDestinationVault._burnUnderlyer` function where `minAmounts` is set to zero, which means any amount of tokens returned from removing the liquidity is acceptable.

185:                 0 // TODO: Make this configurable in initialization so we can target WETH and avoid a swap
186:             )
187:             : BalancerBeethovenAdapter.removeLiquidityImbalance(
188:                 balancerVault,
189:                 balancerPool,

192:                 minAmounts
193:             );
194:     }
```

## Impact

Loss of assets for the vault and its users as described above.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing a mechanism to detect potential manipulation of the pool. In our example, the expected tokens to be received should be a proportional amount (50%:50%) of 25 $Token_{a}$ and 25 $Token_b$. However, if it ends up becoming  40 $Token_a$ and 10 $Token_b$ (80%:20%), the pool obviously has been manipulated, and the TX should stop.
