# Rewards from some destination vaults are not accrued and distributed
## Summary
Rewards from some destination vaults are not accrued and distributed. Users loose yields.
## Vulnerability Detail
Each destination vault [has rewarder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVaultFactory.sol#L78-L85). This rewarder is used to claim rewards. `DestinationVault` will accrue rewards for caller(which is LMPVault always) only [when tokens are moving](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L335-L353). In such cases all accrued rewards by vault [will be withdrawn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/MainRewarder.sol#L73-L84) in form of base asset.

Because of that LMPVault will claim rewards for destination vault, only when someone withdraws from it, or rebalancing is done for this destination vault or debt is updated for destination.

Now, let's check how withdraw happens.

```solidity
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawalQueueLength; ++i) {
                IDestinationVault destVault = IDestinationVault(withdrawalQueue[i]);
                (uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) = _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
                    destVault,
                    shares,
                    info.totalAssetsToPull - Math.max(info.debtDecrease, info.totalAssetsPulled),
                    totalVaultShares
                );
                if (sharesToBurn == 0) {
                    continue;
                }


                uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
                uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));


                // Destination Vault rewards will be transferred to us as part of burning out shares
                // Back into what that amount is and make sure it gets into idle
                info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
                info.totalAssetsPulled += assetPulled;
                info.debtDecrease += totalDebtBurn;


                // It's possible we'll get back more assets than we anticipate from a swap
                // so if we do, throw it in idle and stop processing. You don't get more than we've calculated
                if (info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull) {
                    info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;
                    info.totalAssetsPulled = info.totalAssetsToPull;
                    break;
                }


                // No need to keep going if we have the amount we're looking for
                // Any overage is accounted for above. Anything lower and we need to keep going
                // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
                if (info.totalAssetsPulled == info.totalAssetsToPull) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
```

As you can see there is `withdrawalQueue`, which is just list of destinations. And while withdrawing, these destinations are taken one by one. 
It's possible that first destination has a lot of funds inside, so loop will always break on the first step. As result, rewards will be claimed only for 1 destination, while all next destination's rewards will not be claimed.
Because of that, rewards from other destinations will not increase `idle` and exchange rate will not be increased as well.

Loss of yields for depositors.

## Recommendation
Rewards should be claimed for all destinations.
