# Possible underflow
## Summary
Ensure Careful Casting of types in functions and eliminate the possibility of underflow

## Vulnerability Detail
Potential underflow risk exists when casting from uint256 to uint128, as lockup.end is initially defined in uint256.

## Impact
Possible Loss of Funds due to data loss

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 // duration checked inside previewPoints
        Lockup storage lockup = lockups[msg.sender][lockupId];
        uint256 oldAmount = lockup.amount;
        uint256 oldEnd = lockup.end;
        uint256 oldPoints = lockup.points;

        (uint256 newPoints, uint256 newEnd) = previewPoints(oldAmount, duration);

        if (newEnd <= oldEnd) revert ExtendDurationTooShort();
        lockup.end = uint128(newEnd);
        lockup.points = newPoints;
        lockups[msg.sender][lockupId] = lockup;
        // issue extra points for extension
        _mint(msg.sender, newPoints - oldPoints);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please refrain from casting an arbitrary unbounded quantity from uint256 to uint128 in the case of a possibility of an `amount` going beyond the value of U128.
