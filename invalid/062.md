# Incompatibility with USDT due to Missing Token Approval Reset
## Summary
The `LMPVaultRouterBase` contract contains a issue that makes it incompatible with USDT (Tether) and certain other ERC20 tokens. The vulnerability lies in the `_deposit` function, where the token approval mechanism is not appropriately managed. This flaw can potentially lead to a loss of funds for users.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_deposit` function is intended to deposit assets into an LMPVault and receive shares in return. However, the vulnerability arises due to the improper handling of token approvals. Let's examine the vulnerable code snippet:
```solidity
function _deposit(
    ILMPVault vault,
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 minSharesOut
) internal returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
    approve(IERC20(vault.asset()), address(vault), amount);
    if ((sharesOut = vault.deposit(amount, to)) < minSharesOut) {
        revert MinSharesError();
    }
}
```
## Impact
USDT may become impossible to deposit or to receive as a share

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use safeApprove from openzeppelin 
```solidity
function _deposit(
    ILMPVault vault,
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 minSharesOut
) internal returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
    IERC20 asset = IERC20(vault.asset());

    // Set approval to 0 before re-approving
    asset.safeApprove(address(vault), 0);
    asset.safeApprove(address(vault), amount);

    sharesOut = vault.deposit(amount, to);
    if (sharesOut < minSharesOut) {
        revert MinSharesError();
    }

    // Reset approval to zero after the deposit is done.
    asset.safeApprove(address(vault), 0);
}
```
