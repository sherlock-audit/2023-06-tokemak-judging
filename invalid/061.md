# No Expiration Deadline
## Summary
No Expiration Deadline
## Vulnerability Detail
Without a deadline parameter, the transaction may sit in the mempool and be executed at a much later time potentially resulting in a worse price.
## Impact
In the LiquidationRow.liquidateVaultsForToken() function, the _performLiquidation function is called to execute the actual liquidation process, including token swaps and fee collection.
During the liquidation process, the code does not specify a deadline parameter, which could result in transactions being stuck in the memory pool and waiting for a long time before being executed.
