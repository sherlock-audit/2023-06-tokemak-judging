# ChainlinkOracle will return the wrong price for asset if underlying aggregator hits minAnswer
## Summary
Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price range. The result is that if an asset faces a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash) the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. This happened before to [Venus on BSC](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/) when LUNA imploded.
## Vulnerability Detail
[OffchainAggregator.sol#L680-L684](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/libocr/blob/82b910bef5c1c95cc7a886091ccfc1895bde76f5/contract/OffchainAggregator.sol#L680-L684)
```solidity 
  int192 median = r.observations[r.observations.length/2];
  require(minAnswer <= median && median <= maxAnswer, "median is out of min-max range");
  r.hotVars.latestAggregatorRoundId++;
  s_transmissions[r.hotVars.latestAggregatorRoundId] =
    Transmission(median, uint64(block.timestamp));
```
ChainlinkAggregators have minPrice and maxPrice circuit breakers built into them. This prevents the aggregator from updating the price below the minPrice specified at contract creation.

But current imp;ementeation of ChainlinkOracle.sol doesnot check the scenario . 
```solidity 

   if (
            roundId == 0 || price <= 0 || updatedAt == 0 || updatedAt > timestamp
                || updatedAt < timestamp - tokenPricingTimeout
        ) revert InvalidDataReturned();

```
As per the logic , if the price of the asset drops below the minPrice, the protocol will continue to value the token at minPrice instead of it's actual value. 

Example:

TokenA has a minPrice of 1 dollar . The price of TokenA drops to 0.10 dollar . The aggregator still returns 1 dollar allowing the user to borrow against TokenA as if it is $1 which is 10x it's actual value .

which leads to incorrect pricing of assets in extreme scenario .

Pull minAnswer from the aggregator and revert it price == minAnswer
