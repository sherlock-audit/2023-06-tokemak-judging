# Unbounded loops
## Summary
Unbounded length of destination tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
Utilizing this function may incur high costs due to the associated data array called within this function.

## Impact
Possible DOS under some conditions or high gas cost

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function removeDestinations(
        EnumerableSet.AddressSet storage removalQueue,
        EnumerableSet.AddressSet storage destinations,
        address[] calldata _destinations
    ) external {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _destinations.length; ++i) {
            address dAddress = _destinations[i];
            IDestinationVault destination = IDestinationVault(dAddress);

            // remove from main list (NOTE: done here so balance check below doesn't explode if address is invalid)
            if (!destinations.remove(dAddress)) {
                revert Errors.ItemNotFound();
            }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To enhance performance, it is recommended to define a maximum limit for the array length
