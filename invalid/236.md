# LMPVault withdrawal can be bricked since perWalletLimit also bounds the address(0)
## Summary
LMPVault withdrawal can be bricked since perWalletLimit also bounds the address(0)

## Vulnerability Detail

PoC, includes in test/vault/LMPVault-Withdraw.t.sol 

```solidity
    function test_redeem_More_PerWalletLimit() public {
        _asset.mint(address(this), 1000);
        _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);
        _lmpVault.mint(1000, address(this));
        _lmpVault.setPerWalletLimit(999);
        // burning 1000 would revert since address(0) is also bounded bny walletLimit
        vm.expectRevert();
        _lmpVault.redeem(1000, address(this), address(this));
    }
```


```solidity
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused {
        // Nothing to do really do here
        if (from == to) {
            return;
        }

        // If this isn't a mint of new tokens, then they are being transferred
        // from someone who is "staked" in the rewarder. Make sure they stop earning
        // When they transfer those funds
        if (from != address(0)) {
            rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
        }

        // Make sure the destination wallet total share balance doesn't go above the
        // current perWalletLimit
        if (balanceOf(to) + amount > perWalletLimit) {
            revert OverWalletLimit(to);
        }
    }
```

## Impact
withdrawal can be bricked by the perWalletLimit, as soon as the accumulated burnt token exceeds the perWalletLimit. No token can be burnt since the address(0) cannot take any more token.

This can be easily fixed when the team can simply set the perWalletLimit to type(uint256).max, however this implies the feature to restrict perWalletLimit would become completely broken. 

The high pact(user cannot withdraw) + reversibility  = medium severity, however, resuming the withdrawal workflows also means breaking the perWalletLimit feature, therefore this is considered submitted as a high severity to highlight a broken feature.

## Recommendation
exclude address(0) in the perWalletLimit check
