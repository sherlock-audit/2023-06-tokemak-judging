## Summary
the onNFTHarvest function does not implement what the comment above it indicate that it should do

## Vulnerability Detail
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/rewards/CamelotRewardsAdapter.sol#L74
the onNFTHarvest function does not implement what the comment above it indicate that it should do

## Impact
Lack of validation leading to loss of NFT.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
/**
     * @notice This function is required by Camelot NFTPool if the msg.sender is a contract, to confirm whether it is
     * able to handle reward harvesting.
     */
     //@audit the code does not agree with the comment above.
    function onNFTHarvest(
        address operator,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 grailAmount,
        uint256 xGrailAmount
    ) external returns (bool) {
        if (operator != address(this)) revert WrongOperator(address(this), operator);

        // prevent for harvesting to other address
        if (to != address(this)) revert WrongTo(address(this), to);

        emit OnNFTHarvest(operator, to, tokenId, grailAmount, xGrailAmount);
        return true;
    }
