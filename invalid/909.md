# It is possible to extend a deleted lockup because of the delete keyword
## Summary

There is no check of an existence of a lockup index when calling extend. A user that calls unstake on one index of the lockup array can still extend the deleted index.

## Vulnerability Detail

When calling unstake(), the user's lockup array is deleted from the storage.

```solidity
        _collectRewards(msg.sender, false);


        // remove stake
->      delete lockups[msg.sender][lockupId];

```
When extending the function, there is no check that the lockupId is deleted already.

```solidity
    function extend(uint256 lockupId, uint256 duration) external whenNotPaused {
        if (lockupId >= lockups[msg.sender].length) revert LockupDoesNotExist();


        // before doing anything, make sure the rewards checkpoints are updated!
        _collectRewards(msg.sender, false);


        // duration checked inside previewPoints
        Lockup storage lockup = lockups[msg.sender][lockupId];
        uint256 oldAmount = lockup.amount;
        uint256 oldEnd = lockup.end;
        uint256 oldPoints = lockup.points;


        (uint256 newPoints, uint256 newEnd) = previewPoints(oldAmount, duration);


        if (newEnd <= oldEnd) revert ExtendDurationTooShort();
        lockup.end = uint128(newEnd);
        lockup.points = newPoints;
        lockups[msg.sender][lockupId] = lockup;
        // issue extra points for extension
        _mint(msg.sender, newPoints - oldPoints);


        emit Extend(msg.sender, lockupId, oldAmount, oldEnd, newEnd, oldPoints, newPoints);
    }
```

The user can still call the index of the lockupId and extend its duration.

## Impact

Users can extend an unstake function

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the pop() method to delete the arrays instead, otherwise the delete keyword will simply make every value in the index the default 0 value.

Also, in the extend function, check that the lockup storage is available. 

```solidity
uint oldAmount = lockup.amount; 
if(oldAmount == 0) revert NoMoreStake();
```
