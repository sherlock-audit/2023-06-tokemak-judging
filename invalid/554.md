# `claimRewards` might fail due to gas limit exceed
## Summary
There exists a possibality for `claimRewards` to be DOSed as NFT positions become a large number.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [CamelotRewardsAdapter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/5d8e902ce33981a6506b1b5fb979a084602c6c9a/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/destinations/adapters/rewards/CamelotRewardsAdapter.sol#L49) in `claimRewards` function, `harvestPosition` is called for all the NFT positions in a loop.

```solidity
In claimRewards:

    uint256 length = nftPool.balanceOf(account);

    // harvest all positions

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        uint256 tokenId = nftPool.tokenOfOwnerByIndex(account, i);
        nftPool.harvestPosition(tokenId);
    }
```

Here, `length` could actually be a high number, leading to DOS due to the gas limitation.

## Impact
claimRewards would fail because of gas limit exceed.
