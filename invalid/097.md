# Unregistered Token Unregistration Risk in `unregister` Function
## Summary
The `unregister` function within the contract is designed to facilitate the removal of a Curve LP token from the oracle's records. While the function is straightforward, a potential concern arises from its reliance on the caller to verify the token's registration status before initiating the unregistration process.
## Vulnerability Detail
The unregister function's logic includes a check to determine if the provided Curve LP token is registered:
```solidity
if (lpTokenToUnderlying[curveLpToken].length == 0) {
    revert NotRegistered(curveLpToken);
}
```
The function checks if a token is registered before removing it, but it uses only one way to confirm this. It looks at how many underlying parts the token has. If the count is zero, it assumes the token is not registered and removes it. This could lead to trouble because if the count becomes zero unexpectedly, the function might remove a token that shouldn't be removed.
## Impact
The potential impact of this scenario is that a registered token could be erroneously unregistered, even though it should remain registered. This could disrupt the oracle's data accuracy and functionality, impacting downstream processes relying on the accurate registration status of tokens.

## Recommendation
Implement Cross-Validation: Maintain a separate list or mapping that explicitly tracks registered tokens. Before initiating the unregistration process, cross-validate the token's registration status against this list. This ensures that tokens are only unregistered if their registration status is accurately reflected in both the underlying tokens array and the cross-validation list.
