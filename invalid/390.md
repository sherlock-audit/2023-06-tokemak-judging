# First LMPVault deposit can break share calculation
## Summary

The [**`LMPVault`**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L37) contract is susceptible to an inflation attack. A malicious depositor can exploit the contract to artificially inflate the share price on the initial deposit, causing subsequent depositors to lose assets due to precision issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

A malicious depositor will deposits a small amount of weth token (e.g., 1 WEI) to receive an equivalent number of shares (e.g., 1 share). Subsequently, the malicious depositor can donate additional token to the LMPVault contract without minting new shares. This action inflates the asset balance without increasing the share supply, leading to an artificial inflation of the share price.

***The shares are calculated as following:***

```solidity
    function _convertToShares(uint256 assets, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        return
            (assets == 0 || supply == 0)
                ? _initialConvertToShares(assets, rounding)
                : assets.mulDiv(supply, totalAssets(), rounding);
    }
```

In case of a very high share price, due to **`totalAssets() > assets * supply`**, shares will be 0.

## Impact

LMPVault vault share price can be maliciously inflated on the initial deposit, leading to the next depositor losing assets due to precision issues.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

For the first deposit, mint a fixed amount of shares, **e.g. `10**decimals()`**
