# Using block.timestamp for uniswap and balancer deadline can result in unexpected bad trades for users
## Summary
Using block.timestamp for deadline can result in unexpected losses for users

## Vulnerability Detail

The function swap in UniV3swap is missing a deadline check.

It is also missing in the Balancerswap contract as well

By setting block.timestamp as the deadline, means that a there is no expiration date on a user's transaction. 

This can result in users unknowingly making bad trades due to a low gas fee or a malicious validator holding on to their transaction. 

This affects the function swapanddeposittovault which allows a user to swap their assets before depositing them into a destination vault shown here:

## Impact

Users can unknowingly make bad trades due to a lack of a deadline check in both uniswapV3 and BalancerV2

## Recommendation

Add a deadline parameter to let the user set a deadline for the transaction or set an arbitrary number for it.
