# `BaseAsyncSwapper` can be broken by malicious users due to lack of access control.
## Summary

`BaseAsyncSwapper` can be broken by malicious users due to lack of access control.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `BaseAsyncSwapper.sol` contract is a general purpose swap contract used by the `LiquidationRow.sol` contract to swap vault rewards into the base asset. This is done in the `_performLiquidation` function in `LiquidationRow.sol`.

```solidity
uint256 amountReceived = IAsyncSwapper(asyncSwapper).swap(params);
```

The asyncswapper is called in this function to carry out the swap with the passed params struct. The issue is that any user can call the `BaseAyncSwapper` contract's `swap` function with any input.

```solidity
function swap(SwapParams memory swapParams) public virtual nonReentrant returns (uint256 buyTokenAmountReceived) {
    // ...
    LibAdapter._approve(sellToken, AGGREGATOR, swapParams.sellAmount);
    // ...
    (bool success, ) = AGGREGATOR.call(swapParams.data);
```

The `swap` function then calls a preset aggregator with the swap parameters. Some tokens, like CRV, have an unconventional approval mechanism, which requires users to set the approval to 0 before setting it to some other non-zero amount. In this swapper contract, a malicious user can call this function with some sellAmount of CRV tokens, and then in the params struct, pass the instruction to do a specified tokens out type of swap.

A `specified tokens output` type of a swap basically fixes the amount of output tokens it expects. Thus the contract will give approval to the full amount, but only actually use up part of the allowance. This will leave the swapper contract with non-zero allowance to CRV tokens, and will cause future swap calls to fail, since calling `approve` with a non-zero amount will fail.

The attack can be carried out in the following steps

1. Attacker calls `swap` with the target token to swap as CRV, and sell amount as 1000. Lets assume the quote tokens is USDC, and 1000 CRV should yield 100 USDC.
2. Attacker sets the swapParams such that it does an ExactTokensOut swap. Attacker specifies swapParams.buyAmount as 50.
3. Due to ExactTokensOut type of swap, the swapper converts 500 CRV to 50 USDC. Thus the aggregator still has an allowance of 500CRV unused.
4. When the swapper is called again with CRV token, the swapper will try to call `approve(sellAmount)`. Since the contract already has non-zero allowance, this call will fail, and the swap will fail.

The `approve` function of CRV is shown here:

```vyper
@external
def approve(_spender : address, _value : uint256) -> bool:
    assert _value == 0 or self.allowances[msg.sender][_spender] == 0
    self.allowances[msg.sender][_spender] = _value
    log Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value)
    return True
```

Since the protocol intends to handle CRV tokens as reward tokens from convex / curve pools, this is a high severity issue since any user can break the swapper contract in this method.

## Impact

Broken AsyncSwapper contract for certain tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set the approval to 0 before setting it to `swapParams.sellAmount`. This will ensure that the swapper contract has zero allowance before calling `approve` again.
