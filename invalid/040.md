## Summary
LMPVaultRouter.depositMax can't handle native payment
## Vulnerability Detail
`LMPVaultRouter` extends `LMPVaultRouterBase`. All functions that allow to deposit inside `LMPVaultRouterBase` contract, [can handle native payment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L51).

`LMPVaultRouter` adds additional convenient function, `depositMax`. This function [will not allow user to provide native token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouter.sol#L76C14-L76C24).
