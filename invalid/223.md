# Extra 2 squared lead to miscalculation of the performance fee when rebalancing logic would be executed
## Summary
Within the LMPVault#`_collectFees()`, the 2 squared (`** 2`) is used in the calculation of the `fees` like this: 
```solidity
fees = profit.mulDiv(performanceFeeBps, (MAX_FEE_BPS ** 2), Math.Rounding.Up);   /// @audit 
```
However, this 2 squared (`** 2`) lead to miscalculation of the `fee`. 
As a result, the actual performance fee collected via the LMPVault#`_collectFees()` would be `10000 times` smaller than actual amount to be collected.


## Vulnerability Detail
According to the [**"Performance Fee"** in the Docs of README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/tree/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault#performance-fee), each LMPVault (Autopilot Vault ) can collect a unique performance fee like this:
>_Any time a profit is reported, the protocol is minted shares of the Autopilot Vault to represent the fee they are taking. Autopilot Vaults can have unique fee %’s._


Within the LMPVault contract, `10000` (`100%` in **BPS**) is stored into the `MAX_FEE_BPS` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L62-L63
```solidity
    /// @notice Max fee. 100% == 10000
    uint256 public constant MAX_FEE_BPS = 10_000;
```

Within the LMPVault contract, the `performanceFeeBps` would be defined like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L103-L104
```solidity
    /// @notice Current performance fee taken on profit. 100% == 10000
    uint256 public performanceFeeBps;
```

Within the LMPVault#`setPerformanceFeeBps()`, a performance fee in BPS would be set to the `performanceFeeBps` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L253
```solidity
    /// @notice Set the fee that will be taken when profit is realized
    /// @dev Resets the high water to current value
    /// @param fee Percent. 100% == 10000
    function setPerformanceFeeBps(uint256 fee) external nonReentrant hasRole(Roles.LMP_FEE_SETTER_ROLE) {
        if (fee >= MAX_FEE_BPS) {
            revert InvalidFee(fee);
        }

        performanceFeeBps = fee; /// @audit
        ...
```

Within the LMPVault#`_collectFees()`, the `fee` (performance fee) would be calculated. Then, the amount (`fees`) of the `shares` would be minted to the fee's receiver (`sink`) as the performance fee like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L801
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L819
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L822-L823
```solidity
    function _collectFees(uint256 idle, uint256 debt, uint256 totalSupply) internal {
        address sink = feeSink; /// @audit
        uint256 fees = 0;
        uint256 shares = 0;
        uint256 profit = 0;

        // If there's no supply then there should be no assets and so nothing
        // to actually take fees on
        if (totalSupply == 0) {
            return;
        }

        uint256 currentNavPerShare = ((idle + debt) * MAX_FEE_BPS) / totalSupply;
        uint256 effectiveNavPerShareHighMark = navPerShareHighMark;

        if (currentNavPerShare > effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) {
            // Even if we aren't going to take the fee (haven't set a sink)
            // We still want to calculate so we can emit for off-chain analysis
            profit = (currentNavPerShare - effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) * totalSupply;
            fees = profit.mulDiv(performanceFeeBps, (MAX_FEE_BPS ** 2), Math.Rounding.Up);   /// @audit 
            if (fees > 0 && sink != address(0)) {
                // Calculated separate from other mints as normal share mint is round down
                shares = _convertToShares(fees, Math.Rounding.Up);  /// @audit 
                _mint(sink, shares);  /// @audit
                emit Deposit(address(this), sink, fees, shares);
            }
            ...
```

Within the LMPVault#`_collectFees()` above, the 2 squared (`** 2`) is used in the calculation of the `fees` like this: 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L819
```solidity
fees = profit.mulDiv(performanceFeeBps, (MAX_FEE_BPS ** 2), Math.Rounding.Up);   /// @audit 
```
However, this 2 squared (`** 2`) lead to miscalculation of the `fees`.

Here is a simulation of the calculation process of the `fees`:

Simulation).
Let's say `5%` is set as the `performanceFeeBps` in BPS. 
```solidity
fees = profit.mulDiv(performanceFeeBps, (MAX_FEE_BPS ** 2), Math.Rounding.Up);
fees = profit.mulDiv(500, (10000 ** 2), Math.Rounding.Up);
fees = profit.mulDiv(500, 100000000, Math.Rounding.Up);
```
In this case, which `5%` (`500`) would be set as the `performanceFeeBps` in BPS, the division above is supposed to be `10000`.
However, as we can see the calculation above, the division above is `100000000`.

As a result, the `shares` to be minted to the fee's receiver (`sink`) based on the `fees` above would be `10000 times` smaller than actual amount to be minted. ([LMPVault.sol#L822-L823](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L822-L823))

This means that the actual performance fee collected via the LMPVault#`_collectFees()` would be `10000 times` smaller than actual amount to be collected.


## Impact
The LMPVault#`_collectFees()` would be called in the rebalancing logic below:
- LMPVault#`rebalance()`
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L703
```solidity
    function rebalance(RebalanceParams memory params) public nonReentrant hasRole(Roles.SOLVER_ROLE) trackNavOps {
        ...
        _collectFees(idle, debt, totalSupply()); /// @audit
    }
```

- LMVVault#`flashRebalance()`
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L727
```solidity
    function flashRebalance(
        IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver,
        RebalanceParams memory rebalanceParams,
        bytes calldata data
    ) public nonReentrant hasRole(Roles.SOLVER_ROLE) trackNavOps {
        ...
        _collectFees(idle, debt, totalSupply()); /// @audit
    }
```

Thus, every single time when the rebalance logic would be executed and a profit would be reported, the only performance fee, which is `10000` times smaller amount than the actual amount to be collected, would be collected. 

This means that the fee's receiver of each LMPVault can collect only `10000` times smaller performance fee than the actual performance fee, which the fee's receiver of each LMPVault is supposed to collect.

(NOTE：The performance fee is collected in the form of `shares`)

## Tool used
- Manual Review


## Recommendation
Within the LMPVault#`_collectFees()`, consider removing 2 squared (`** 2`) from the calculation of the `fee` like this: 
```solidity
    function _collectFees(uint256 idle, uint256 debt, uint256 totalSupply) internal { /// @audit info - "Performance Fee"
        ...
        if (currentNavPerShare > effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) {
            ...
+           fees = profit.mulDiv(performanceFeeBps, (MAX_FEE_BPS), Math.Rounding.Up);
-           fees = profit.mulDiv(performanceFeeBps, (MAX_FEE_BPS ** 2), Math.Rounding.Up);
            ...
```
