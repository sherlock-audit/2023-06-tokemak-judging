# Add Liquidity to Curve ETH pools will not work
## Summary

When deploy liquidity to Curve pool, protocol need to call `addLiquidity()` to add liquidity to the curve pool.

But this function only work for non-ETH related curve pools.


## Vulnerability Detail

Function CurveV2FactoryCryptoAdapter#addLiquidity could deploy liquidity to Curve pool, it should support ETH and non-ETH curve pool, but this function only work for non-ETH related curve pools because it lacks of `payable` keyword to support users deploy ETH liquidity to the contract.


## Impact

Protocol curve adapter will not support ETH pool deployment because the related function only work for non-ETH related curve pools.
