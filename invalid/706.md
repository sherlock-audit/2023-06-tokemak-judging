# Users can claim rewards when `LMPVault` is paused
## Summary

The `LMPVault.claimRewards()` function has the `whenNotPaused` modifier which means that it should only be callable when contract is not paused but users can bypass this check by calling directly the Rewarder `getReward` function to claim their rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `LMPVault.claimRewards()` function below is implementing the `whenNotPaused` modifier meaning it is only callable when contract is not paused, the function claims the caller rewards by calling the `rewarder.getReward` function :

```solidity
function claimRewards() public whenNotPaused {
    rewarder.getReward(msg.sender, true);
}
```

The `rewarder.getReward` function is defined as follows (for the main rewarder) :

```solidity
function getReward(address account, bool claimExtras) external nonReentrant {
    // @audit can be called directly by account
    if (msg.sender != address(stakeTracker) && msg.sender != account) {
        revert Errors.AccessDenied();
    }
    _updateReward(account);
    _processRewards(account, claimExtras);
}
```

As you can see the function can either be called by `stakeTracker` (which is the `LMPVault`) or the same user as the account address provided.

So if now Bob wanted to claim his rewards but the `LMPVault` contract was paused (or the whole system `isSystemPaused()`), he can't use the `LMPVault.claimRewards()` function as it will revert due to the `whenNotPaused` modifier but he can bypass this check by calling directly the the Rewarder `getReward` function which will send him his rewards.

## Recommendation

To avoid this issue i recommend to allow only the `LMPVault` contract to call the Rewarder `getReward` function or to implement a check in the `getReward` function to get the `LMPVault` paused state and revert if it's paused.
