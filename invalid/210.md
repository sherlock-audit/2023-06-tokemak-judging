# `_handleRebalanceIn` under **LMPDebt** will not work properly due to wrong approvals
## Summary
[_handleRebalanceIn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L327) under [LMPDebt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol) will not work properly since crv v1 and v2 LP tokens need to be approved to 0 first, or else the transfer will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in CRV [docs](https://curve.readthedocs.io/exchange-lp-tokens.html?highlight=lp#curve-token-v2)
> For Curve LP Tokens V1 and V2, non-zero to non-zero approvals are prohibited. Instead, after every non-zero approval, the allowance for the spender must be reset to 0.

The tokens must be treated the same way USDT is treated, approving 0 and then the amount needed. If this is not done, like in this case, the first re-balance will pass, but even if 1 wei of approval is left after a given re-balance every call afterwards will revert.

This function is used in [rebalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L691-L704) and [flashRebalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L707-L728) which means if re-balance is called with crv LP tokens it will revert the whole call and make it impossible for them to re-balance.

## Impact
Pool is unable to re-balance on crv v1 and v2 pools.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change from [safeApprove](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/libs/LMPDebt.sol#L327) to [LibAdapter._approve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/libs/LibAdapter.sol#L19-L25)

```diff
-       IERC20(tokenIn).safeApprove(address(dvIn), depositAmount);
+       LibAdapter._approve(tokenIn,address(dvIn), depositAmount);

        // Snapshot our current shares so we know how much to back out
        uint256 originalShareBal = dvIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        
```
