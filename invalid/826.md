# Anyone can steal residual funds from router contract
## Summary
[`LMPVaultRouterBase`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol) has `sweepToken` and `refundETH` functions lacking access control, allowing anyone to steal funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
[`PeripheryPayments.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/utils/PeripheryPayments.sol) inherited by LMPVaultRouterBase has the [`sweepToken()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/utils/PeripheryPayments.sol#L58) function to collect the extra token stuck in router contract.


However, these functions are without any access control, meaning anyone can call these and collect the funds stuck in the router contract.

Consider `sweepToken()` and `refundETH()` which simply transfer any token in LMPVaultRouterBase.sol to the `msg.sender`.
[`PeripheryPayments#L58-L69`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/utils/PeripheryPayments.sol#L58-L69)
```solidity
    function sweepToken(IERC20 token, uint256 amountMinimum, address recipient) public payable {
        uint256 balanceToken = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (balanceToken < amountMinimum) revert InsufficientToken();

        if (balanceToken > 0) {
            token.safeTransfer(recipient, balanceToken);
        }
    }
 
    function refundETH() external payable {
        if (address(this).balance > 0) Address.sendValue(payable(msg.sender), address(this).balance);
    }

```

Also, consider the [`approve()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/utils/PeripheryPayments.sol#L35) which grants the approval of any token owned by the router to `msg.sender`

Malicious user can set up a bot to monitor the amount of funds being transferred to the Router contract and then steal those as shown above.

## Impact
- Loss of user funds.
- As there is a ETH/WETH deposit issue (mentioned in a different issue) wherein users' funds will be stuck in the router contract, these excess funds can be easily stolen with this exploit.
