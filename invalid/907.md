# Zero minAmount can lead to redundant funds being withdrawn out of other destination vault
## Summary
Zero `buyMinAmount` is used for the destination vaults swap as slippage which can be exploited by MEV sandwich attack. As a result, LMPVault ends up burning unnecessary shares to cover up for the losses each time a user withdraws.

User is protected against slippage but protocol as a whole is not.

## Vulnerability Detail

When users decide to withdraw their assets or redeem their shares from the LMPVault, the process involves several steps. 
1. Initially, LMPVault taps into its idle accounting, an internal reserve owned by the vault itself.

2. If necessary, the vault may also draw from its debt accounting, which consists of already transferred funds to designated destination vaults for the purpose of generating yields.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L458

- Each LMPVault is associated with a set of destination vaults where its funds are allocated to generate yields. These destination vaults are stored within an array called the [`withdrawalQueue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L98), which maintains a specific order. This orderly arrangement is important because when funds are required for user withdrawals, they are pulled from these destination vaults in accordance with the sequence defined in the `withdrawalQueue`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L465-L483

3. The [`destVault.withdrawBaseAsset()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L244) process involves a cascading series of steps within each destination vault. 
- Firstly, the destination vault initiates the withdrawal of its liquidity tokens tied to corresponding pairs of tokens, the particular token pairs depend on the external yield protocol in use. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L255

- These tokens are then converted into the base asset and subsequently transferred back to the original LMPVault. An important outcome during this step is the burning of shares held by the LMPVault.

- `destVault.withdrawBaseAsset()` will be called for each destination vault in the order specified, until a sufficient quantity of the base asset is collected to meet the withdrawal amount requested by the user.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L493-L505
4. The cumulative amount gathered is then compared with the minimum amount specified in the withdrawal function, ensuring that the user receives at least their desired withdrawal amount. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L102-L104

   https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L416-L418

`This is a perfect slippage check from the user's perspective as the user will receive the minimum amount requested no matter what`.

However, the problem arises when the destination vault tries to swap the received token pair into baseAsset.
- Specifically, the minBuyAmount for `swapRouter.swapForQuote()` is set to zero.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L273
- Here, this minBuyAmount is then used to compare to the actual amount of baseAsset received after swapping
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/SwapRouter.sol#L123-L124

- As it provides no protection against slippage. Allowing the malicious user to profit by sandwiching the protocols swap transaction. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/SwapRouter.sol#L90-L102

- As a result, a very low amount of baseAsset will be sent back to LMPVault from this particular destination vault. 
- Now to cover for the remaining amount of baseAsset for the user, LMPVault will call the next destination Vault in `withdrawalQueue`, which is also susceptible to the same described attack.

`Tldr; The User will get the requested baseAsset and their slippage will be respected but LMPVault will suffer by burning unnecessary shares because destination vault swap functionality is not protected against slippage.`
## Impact

The LMPVault system will face losses due to unfavorable swaps. To counteract these losses, redundant shares will burned in other destination vaults.

Ultimately loss for users of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Set suitable minBuyAmount based on the valuation of the shares being burned.
- Say as an example (considering 10% slippage )if the value of the LPToken (Underlyer) was K amount, don't accept the base asset worth less than 0.9K.
