# LMPVault is not 4626 compatible
## Summary

LMPVault does not conform to ERC4626 due to rounding up when calculating shares in **`_collectFees()`**.

## Vulnerability Detail

As per of the readme: 

> Is the code/contract expected to comply with any EIPs? Are there specific assumptions around adhering to those EIPs that Watsons should be aware of?

> src/vault/LMPVault.sol should be 4626 compatible

The ERC4626 [specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) states that **`convertToShares()`** MUST round down towards 0.

The LMPVault should be 4626 compatible which means that it must comply with all the specs without exeption.

However, the **`_collectFees()`** is rounding up when converting to shares:

```solidity
            if (fees > 0 && sink != address(0)) {
                // Calculated separate from other mints as normal share mint is round down
                shares = _convertToShares(fees, Math.Rounding.Up);
                _mint(sink, shares);
                emit Deposit(address(this), sink, fees, shares);
            }
```

The protocol shouldnâ€™t be advertised as 4626 compatible if it dosen't comply with all the specs.

PS: It's worth noting that there is no apparent gain in rounding up, except for the negative outcome of breaking compatibility with ERC4626 specs:

```solidity
    function test_RoundingDiff() public { 
        _accessController.grantRole(Roles.SOLVER_ROLE, address(this));
        _accessController.grantRole(Roles.LMP_FEE_SETTER_ROLE, address(this));

        FlashRebalancer rebalancer = new FlashRebalancer();

        _asset.mint(address(this), 1000);
        _asset.approve(address(_lmpVault), 1000);
        _lmpVault.deposit(1000, address(this));

        rebalancer.snapshotAsset(address(_asset), 500);

        _underlyerOne.mint(address(this), 250);
        _underlyerOne.approve(address(_lmpVault), 250);
        _lmpVault.flashRebalance(
            rebalancer,
            IStrategy.RebalanceParams({
                destinationIn: address(_destVaultOne),
                tokenIn: address(_underlyerOne),
                amountIn: 250,
                destinationOut: address(0),
                tokenOut: address(_asset),
                amountOut: 500
            }),
            abi.encode("")
        );

        address feeSink = vm.addr(555);
        _lmpVault.setFeeSink(feeSink);

        _lmpVault.setPerformanceFeeBps(2000); // 20%

        _mockRootPrice(address(_underlyerOne), 4e18);

        _lmpVault.updateDebtReporting(_destinations);

        // Rounding Up: 

                    // FeeCollected(fees: 45, feeSink: 0x**, mintedShares: 31, profit: 2249100, idle: 500, debt: 1000)

        // Rounding Down:      

                    // FeeCollected(fees: 45, feeSink: 0x**, mintedShares: 30, profit: 2249100, idle: 500, debt: 1000)

    }
```

## Impact

LMPVault does not conform to ERC4626 which may break external integrations.

## Recommendation

We recommend rounding down as follow:

```solidity
shares = _convertToShares(fees, Math.Rounding.Down);
```
