# Curve oracle manipulation possible with read only reentrancy in `get_virtual_price`. And curve pool uses vulnerable vyper version.
## Summary
`get_virtual_price()` was originally considered to be a manipulation-resistant price - suitable as a price oracle, but it was later found to be vulnerable to a [read-only reentrancy](https://chainsecurity.com/curve-lp-oracle-manipulation-post-mortem/) attack. The attacker could use this to artificially inflate the price of the LP token/its balance, and use the inflated balance to take out loans which become undercollateralized at the end of the transaction, or to buy assets at exchange rates not actually available on the open market.

- `get_virtual_price(`) is used in the above functions. It can easily be manipulated with read-only reentrancy and the attack is well explained in this [article](https://chainsecurity.com/curve-lp-oracle-manipulation-post-mortem/).
- On sunday 31-07-2023, a zero-day affecting vyper compiler versions v0.2.15-0.3.0 has been found and exploited in order to drain multiple curve pools.
- Although no concrete exploit has been found as a result of the non-working reentrancy lock:

## Impact
Curve classic problem [read-only reentrant](https://chainsecurity.com/heartbreaks-curve-lp-oracles/), `get_virtual_price` can be manipulated which is used for pricing LP tokens.

## Recommendation
Use TWAP to determine the prices of the underlying assets in the pool. Or Add a reentrancy guard to protect against reentrancy.
