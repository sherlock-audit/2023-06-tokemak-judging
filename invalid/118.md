# Possible inaccurate pricing calculations in UniswapV2EthOracle contract
## Summary
The `totalDecimals` calculation in the register function of the `UniswapV2EthOracle` contract might lead to an overflow issue due to the addition of two `uint8` values representing the decimals of `token0` and `token1`.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `totalDecimals` calculation in the register function attempts to calculate the sum of the decimals of `token0` and `token1`:
```solidity
uint8 totalDecimals = IERC20Metadata(token0).decimals() + IERC20Metadata(token1).decimals();
```
The purpose of this calculation is to determine the total number of decimal places for the tokens. However, the issue arises from the use of `uint8` data type for `totalDecimals`. In situations where both `token0` and `token1` have relatively high decimal values, the sum of these decimals might exceed the maximum value that can be represented by a `uint8` (255). This will result in an overflow, causing unexpected behavior and potentially incorrect calculations.
## Impact
The overflow issue could lead to incorrect calculations and behavior when registering LP tokens with high decimal values for both `token0` and `token1`. Incorrect `totalDecimals` calculations may lead to erroneous padding values and inaccurate pricing calculations, affecting the reliability of the price oracle's results.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address the potential overflow issue and ensure that the sum of decimals doesn't exceed the range of uint8, you can use the .add function from the OpenZeppelin library. This function performs the addition and reverts if the result exceeds the maximum value of the data type. Here's how you can apply it:
```solidity
uint8 totalDecimals = uint8(uint256(IERC20Metadata(token0).decimals()).add(IERC20Metadata(token1).decimals()));
```
