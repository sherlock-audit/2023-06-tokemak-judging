# new points minted are less than what the staker should receive
## Summary
the amount minted during stake extension is less
## Vulnerability Detail
when a staker extends their stake, they are minted new points. this is calculated by subracting the new points from the old points.
this is however wrong. stakers should receive their new points in full as the previewPoints method where the amount of points is calculated treats the extension period as a new stake.
## Impact
stakers end up losing their voting power
