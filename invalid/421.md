# LP token price can be manipulated by manipulating the price of any single underlying token
## Summary
The way getPriceInEth works in the CurveV1StableEthOracle contract allows an attacker to manipulate the price returned for an LP token
## Vulnerability Detail
It loops through all the underlying tokens for a given LP token [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/CurveV1StableEthOracle.sol#L117-L118)  [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/CurveV1StableEthOracle.sol#L127-L128) [Link 3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/CurveV1StableEthOracle.sol#L140-L149). It sets the final LP token price to the minimum underlying token price multiplied by the virtual price [Link 4](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/CurveV1StableEthOracle.sol#L155). 
This means that any single underlying token can set the final LP token price by returning a very low/manipulated price from getPriceInEth. For example, if there are 3 underlying tokens with true prices of 1 ETH, 2 ETH, and 3 ETH respectively, but the attacker manipulates the first token to return a price of 0.001 ETH, then the final LP price will be set to 0.001 ETH * virtualPrice, even though the true LP value should be much higher based on the non-manipulated token prices.
This is a vulnerability since it means anyone can artificially reduce the LP token price by manipulating a single underlying asset price.


## Impact
An attacker could manipulate the price of one of the underlying tokens to be lower than the fair market price. This low price would become the minPrice, and the final output price for the LP token would be reduced.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the pricing approach to use a weighted average of the underlying token prices rather than just the minimum.
