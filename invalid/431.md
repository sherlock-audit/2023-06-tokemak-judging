# The ````extend()```` function of  ````GPToke```` contract would revert unexpectedly
## Summary
The ````extend()```` function of  ````GPToke```` contract would revert unexpectedly while users call it with a shorter ````duration```` than the previous one.

## Vulnerability Detail
Please look at the implementation of ````extend()````, let's say:
(1) Alice initially staked at ````2024-01-01```` with ````duration = 1 years```` and got ````1000 points````. 
(2) Then, at ````2025-01-01````, she wants to extend  ````6 months````, so ````newPoints = 500```` and ````newEnd = 2025-07-01```` (L170)
Obviously, the check on L172 will pass. But on L177, the transaction will revert unexpectedly due to overflow (````newPoints - oldPoints = 500 - 1000````).
```solidity
File: src\staking\GPToke.sol
158:     function extend(uint256 lockupId, uint256 duration) external whenNotPaused {
159:         if (lockupId >= lockups[msg.sender].length) revert LockupDoesNotExist();
160: 
161:         // before doing anything, make sure the rewards checkpoints are updated!
162:         _collectRewards(msg.sender, false);
163: 
164:         // duration checked inside previewPoints
165:         Lockup storage lockup = lockups[msg.sender][lockupId];
166:         uint256 oldAmount = lockup.amount;
167:         uint256 oldEnd = lockup.end;
168:         uint256 oldPoints = lockup.points;
169: 
170:         (uint256 newPoints, uint256 newEnd) = previewPoints(oldAmount, duration);
171: 
172:         if (newEnd <= oldEnd) revert ExtendDurationTooShort();
173:         lockup.end = uint128(newEnd);
174:         lockup.points = newPoints;
175:         lockups[msg.sender][lockupId] = lockup;
176:         // issue extra points for extension
177:         _mint(msg.sender, newPoints - oldPoints);
178: 
179:         emit Extend(msg.sender, lockupId, oldAmount, oldEnd, newEnd, oldPoints, newPoints);
180:     }

```



## Impact
Users of ````GPToke```` contract can't extend their stakings with a shorter ````duration````. To achieve similar result, users must call ````unstake()```` first and then call ````stake()```` again, pay gas fee twice.
