# Unauthorized Destination Replacement Vulnerability
## Summary
Allowing non-whitelisted destinations to be replaced can potentially lead to unauthorized or malicious contracts being used as replacements, which may result in unexpected behavior, security vulnerabilities, or even financial loss.
## Vulnerability Detail
The whitelist serves as a safeguard to ensure that only trusted and vetted destinations can be used in the system.
The issue lies in the assumption that `existingDestination` being non-zero implies that the destination is whitelisted. However, it is possible for `existingDestination` to be non-zero even if the destination is not in the whitelist. This is because the code does not perform a check for whitelisted destinations.
## Impact
By bypassing the whitelist, a malicious user may substitute trusted destinations with unauthorized or malicious contracts, compromising the system's integrity and exposing it to various risks. as it undermines the purpose of the whitelist, which is to ensure secure and trusted interactions with external contracts or destinations. By allowing unauthorized replacements,

            bytes32 destination = destinationTypes[i];
            IDestinationAdapter existingDestination = destinations[destination];
            Errors.verifyNotZero(address(existingDestination), "existingDestination");

            if (address(existingDestination) == target) {
                revert DestinationAlreadySet();

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would recommend adding a check to ensure that the destination being replaced is whitelisted before performing the replacement.

            bytes32 destination = destinationTypes[i];
            if (!isWhitelistedDestination(destination)) {
            revert NotAllowedDestination(); // Add check for whitelisted destination
           }

             IDestinationAdapter existingDestination = destinations[destination];
             Errors.verifyNotZero(address(existingDestination), "existingDestination");
