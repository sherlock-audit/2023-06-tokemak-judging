# Destination rewards should only be claimable by LiquidatorRow contract
## Summary

1. Currently `collectRewards()` of `desitnationVault` can be directly called by `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` which shouldn't be possible because the intended flow is `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` should call `claimsVaultRewards()` function of `LiquidationRow` which should only be able to call `collectRewards()` of destination vaults.
2. Reward accouting will go wrong if the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` directly calls `collectRewards()`

## Vulnerability Detail
1. The `collectRewards()` functions of destination vaults should only be called by `LiquidationRow` contract because it is the contract which tracks the reward balances of each destination and liquidates them and add the liquidated funds as rewards to the destination vault `Rewarder`.
3. So the actual flow should be 
  LIQUIDATOR_ROLE calls `claimsVaultRewards()` on LiquidationRow contract
  LIQUIDATION_ROW_ROLE calls `collectRewards()` on destination vault contract.
4. So a new role called `LIQUIDATION_ROW_ROLE` should be added and `collectRewards()` function of destination vault should only called by this role.


## Impact
1. There is no guarantee for the protocol users that the rewards will always only claimed by LiquidationRow contract because a `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` can call the collectRewards() on vaults directly  instead of calling claimsVaultRewards() on `LiquidationRow` contract.
2. Reward accouting will go wrong if the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` directly calls `collectRewards` on destination vaults.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a new role called `LIQUIDATION_ROW_ROLE` and make sure the `collectRewards()` should be only callable by this role

```diff
    function collectRewards()
        external
        virtual
        override
-       hasRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE)
+       hasRole(Roles.LIQUIDATION_ROW_ROLE)
        returns (uint256[] memory amounts, address[] memory tokens)
    {
        (amounts, tokens) = _collectRewards();
    }
```
