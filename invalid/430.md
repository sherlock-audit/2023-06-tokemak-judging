# reward rate can be dragged out and diluted
## Summary
reward rate can be dragged out and diluted by malicious actors

## Vulnerability Detail

The notifyRewardAmount function receives a reward amount and extends the current reward end time to now + durationInBlock. It rebases the currently remaining rewards + the new rewards (reward + leftover) over this new durationInBlock period. This can lead to a dilution of the reward rate and rewards being dragged out forever by malicious new reward deposits.

```solidity
         .....
        if (block.number < periodInBlockFinish) {
            uint256 remaining = periodInBlockFinish - block.number;
            // slither-disable-next-line divide-before-multiply
            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            reward += leftover;
        }

        rewardRate = reward / durationInBlock;
       ....
```


1. Imagine the current rewardRate is 1000 rewards / durationInBlock .
2. 20% of the durationInBlock passed, i.e., now = lastUpdateBlock + 20% * durationInBlock .
3. A malicious actor notifies the contract with a reward of 0: notifyRewardAmount(0).
4. Then the new rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / durationInBlock = (0 + 800) / durationInBlock = 800 / durationInBlock
5. The rewardRate just dropped by 20%. This can be repeated infinitely. After another 20% of reward time passed, they trigger notifyRewardAmount(0) to reduce it by another 20% again: rewardRate = (0 + 640) / durationInBlock = 640 / durationInBlock .

## Impact

Admin privilege issue that would allow the admin to dilute current rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review + in-house tool

## Recommendation

The rewardRate should never decrease by a notifyRewardAmount call. Consider not extending the reward payouts by durationInBlock on every call. periodInBlockFinish probably shouldnâ€™t change at all, the rewardRate should just increase by rewardRate += reward / (periodInBlockFinish- block.number).

Alternatively, consider keeping the rewardRate constant but extend periodInBlockFinishtime by += reward / rewardRate.
