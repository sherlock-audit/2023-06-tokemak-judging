# The `AuraRewardsAdapter.claimRewards` allows anyone to pass their own account address in `sendTo` param and claim rewards.
## Summary

The `AuraRewardsAdapter.claimRewards` allows anyone to pass their own account address in `sendTo` param and claim rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `claimRewards` calls `ConvexRewards.claimRewards` where it passes `sendTo` param which is given by user, so any reward tokens will be sent directly to user and not the protocol.

There is no access control, and the function is open to all users which allows anyone to grab the reward tokens.

```solidity
    function claimRewards(
        address gauge,
        address defaultToken,
        address sendTo
    ) public returns (uint256[] memory amounts, address[] memory tokens) {
        // no check for the `sendTo` account. Anyone can steal tokens.
        (amounts, tokens) = ConvexRewards.claimRewards(gauge, defaultToken, sendTo);
    }
```

## Impact

Loss of reward tokens as anybody could call that function.

```solidity
    function claimRewards(
        address gauge,
        address defaultToken,
        address sendTo
    ) public returns (uint256[] memory amounts, address[] memory tokens) {
        // no check for the `sendTo` account. Anyone can steal tokens.
        (amounts, tokens) = ConvexRewards.claimRewards(gauge, defaultToken, sendTo);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Devs probably meant to pass `account` as third param, like it is done in other Adapter contracts:

```solidity
address account = address(this);
```
