# `getPriceInEth` in  `TellorOracle.sol` doesn't uses the best practices recommended by Tellor which can cause wrong pricing
## Summary
The function `getPriceInEth` it is used to call Tellor oracle to check the prices of different assets but the implementation doesn't respect the best practices recommended by Tellor which can cause wrong pricing.
## Vulnerability Detail
Tellor team has a **Development Checklist** 
https://docs.tellor.io/tellor/getting-data/user-checklists#development-checklist
that is important to use when you are using Tellor protocol to protect yourself against stale prices and also to limit dispute attacks. The prices in Tellor protocol can be disputed and changed in case of malicious acting and because of that dispute attacks can happen which would make the prices unstable. `getPriceInEth` calls `getDataBefore`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/TellorOracle.sol#L105
and uses the timestamp returned to check if the prices are stale or not using `DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT` or `tellorStoredTimeout`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/TellorOracle.sol#L107-L112
The value of the `DEFAULT_PRICING_TIMEOUT` is 2 hours and the frame of time where a dispute could happen is around 12 hours as per Tellor documentation, which could make `getPriceInEth` revert multiple times because of possible dispute attacks that could happen. The way the Tellor protocol recommends to limit the possibility of dispute attacks is by caching the most recent values and timestamps as can seen here in their example 
https://github.com/tellor-io/tellor-caller-liquity/blob/3ed91e4b15f0bac737f2966e36805ade3daf8162/contracts/TellorCaller.sol#L9-L11
Basically every time data is returned it is checked against the last stored values and in case of a dispute attack it will return the last stored undisputed and accurate value as can be seen here 
https://github.com/tellor-io/tellor-caller-liquity/blob/3ed91e4b15f0bac737f2966e36805ade3daf8162/contracts/TellorCaller.sol#L51-L58
It is also important to note that the Tellor protocol checks for data returned to not be 0
https://github.com/tellor-io/tellor-caller-liquity/blob/3ed91e4b15f0bac737f2966e36805ade3daf8162/contracts/TellorCaller.sol#L51
which is not done in the `getPriceInEth`, so in the case of a 0 value it will be decoded 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/TellorOracle.sol#L114
and then passed into `_denominationPricing`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/TellorOracle.sol#L115
which would return a 0 value that could hurt the protocol.
## Impact
Medium of because of wrong pricing or multiple revert in case of dispute attacks

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend to use the Tellor example in 
https://github.com/tellor-io/tellor-caller-liquity/blob/main/contracts/TellorCaller.sol
and implement mappings to cache the values all the time, similar to how Tellor does it to limit as much as possible dispute attacks and also check for 0 value.
