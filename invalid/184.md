# CurveV2Swap will not work correctly as pool.exchange returns uint[2]
## Summary
CurveV2Swap will not work correctly and will even revert in multi-hop swap, because it returns the wrong values.

## Vulnerability Detail
Under the section labeled [swap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/CurveV2Swap.sol#L31-L45), the operation `pool.exchange` is invoked, facilitating a call to the CRV2 stable pools. However, a mismatch arises as our existing swap mechanism yields a solitary `uint256`, whereas `pool.exchange` delivers an array of `uint256` values: `in` and `out`.

The curve [documentation](https://docs.curve.fi/LLAMMA/amm/?h=exchange#exchange) unfolds the exchange process, revealing that the returned array is structured as 
`[in_amount_done, out_amount_done]`. Our function's [current implementation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters/CurveV2Swap.sol#L38) issues just a singular `uint256`, thereby exclusively capturing `in_amount_done`. This captures the amount extracted from CurveV2Swap, but fails to return what we actually need, the subsequently received amount. As a result of this mismatch, the swapping process produces incorrect results. This issue becomes even more problematic when these swaps are used one after another, creating a chain of swaps. In such cases, the subsequent swap operation [believes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/SwapRouter.sol#L119) it has a certain amount to work with, but unfortunately, this amount is actually incorrect. This can lead to failures or errors in the overall process.

## Impact
Multi-hop swap will fail when one of them uses crvV2 swapper.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either the second value should be returned, or alternatively, a more effective approach would be to modify the process under [SwapRouter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/SwapRouter.sol#L119). Instead of relying on the returned value from the previous swap as the new input for the subsequent one, a new balance can be taken with `token.balanceOf(address(this))`
```diff
-          currentAmount = abi.decode(data, (uint256));
+          currentAmount = IERC20(currentToken).balanceOf(address(this));
```
