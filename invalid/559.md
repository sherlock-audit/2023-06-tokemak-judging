# First depositor can break vault shares
## Summary

The vault follows the ERC4626 standard, where shares are determined by the deposited amount. When a significant initial deposit is made, the first depositor can impact the value for subsequent depositors.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `LMPVault.sol` shares are calculated based on the deposit value.
With a large deposit,the first depositor gains an upper hand over other depositors.

```solidity
    function mint(
        uint256 shares,
        address receiver
    ) public virtual override nonReentrant noNavChange ensureNoNavOps returns (uint256 assets) {
        if (shares > maxMint(receiver)) {
            revert ERC4626MintExceedsMax(shares, maxMint(receiver));
        }

        assets = previewMint(shares);

        _transferAndMint(assets, shares, receiver);
    }
```

```solidity
    function previewMint(uint256 shares) public view virtual returns (uint256 assets) {
        assets = _convertToAssets(shares, Math.Rounding.Up);
    }
```

```solidity
    function _convertToAssets(uint256 shares, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256 assets) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        assets = (supply == 0) ? shares : shares.mulDiv(totalAssets(), supply, rounding);
    }
```


## Impact
The attacker can profit from future users' deposits and they are forced for huge value of asset to deposit.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Mint a minumum amount of shares for the first minter. And send some of the initial tokens to the DAO or burn them. This helps the share price stay less vulnerable to manipulation.
