# Potential loss of funds for users due to lack of atomic refund on mints using native ETH
## Summary
Users who mint using native ETH in LMPVaults could lose funds due to mint and refund functionality not being atomic.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users are expected to be able to mint into LMPVaults with native ETH using the ``mint`` and ``deposit`` function defined in ``LMPVaultRouterBase``. The transferred ETH is first wrapped to WETH by the router before the mint process takes place, increasing the *router's* WETH balance (since the deposit call is made from the router).

Consider the case where a user attempts to mint using only native ETH (for simplicity). Assume that the router does not attempt to pull WETH from the user (note that currently, all WETH required is pulled from the caller which causes reverts in most cases (due to the user not expecting the need to approve the router funds when they have provided native ETH) or otherwise results in the router holding double the WETH amount it should be holding for the mint if the user has approved the router for the ``msg.value`` WETH). After the mint is performed, it is checked that the WETH deposited (equal to the amount previewed before the mint) does not exceed the ``maxAmountIn`` specified by the user (which should generally be the previewed amount when the transaction was first submitted and therefore equal to the total WETH held by the router). 

The issue arises when the WETH deposited is less than the original ETH value sent in by the user (e.g. due to change in share prices because of delay between the transaction's submission and execution times). The remaining WETH in the router is not atomically refunded to the user, leaving it exposed for anyone to take using the public ``sweepToken`` function in the ``PeripheryPayments`` library. Additionally, ``withdraw`` and ``redeem`` calls with ``unwrapWETH`` set to true will unwrap the router's *whole* WETH balance, so unused WETH for user mints could be taken without malicious intent due to ``withdraw`` and ``redeem`` transactions following the mint, preventing users the opportunity of regaining their funds.

While this issue could be avoided by the user wrapping their WETH manually, this  functionality should then not be offered due to the risk it prevents.

## Impact
Potential loss of funds for unsuspecting users who attempt to mint LMPVault shares using native ETH due to lack of atomic refunds of unused WETH.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider refunding unused WETH if native ETH has been transferred in (also applicable to ``deposit``). Additionally, consider changing the logic for ``mint`` to only attempt to pull in additional WETH if ``msg.value`` is insufficient.
