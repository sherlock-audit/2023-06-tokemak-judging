# Contracts are vulnerable to rebasing accounting-related issues
## Summary

Contracts are vulnerable to rebasing accounting-related issues

## Vulnerability Detail
Rebasing tokens are tokens that have each holder's balanceof() increase over time. Aave aTokens are an example of such tokens. 

## Impact
If rebasing tokens are used, rewards accrue to the contract holding the tokens, and cannot be withdrawn by the original depositor.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address the issue, track 'shares' deposited on a pro-rata basis, and let shares be redeemed for their proportion of the current balance at the time of the withdrawal.
