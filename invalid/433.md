# No check for existing extraRewards during push
## Summary

There is no check for existing extraRewards in `addExtraReward`and due to a misconfiguration error, a leak of value can happen, and other depositors (late withdrawers) would lose the rewards that they are entitled to.

## Vulnerability Detail

Assume a particular address takes up 2 slots out of 3, and a user withdraws staked extra rewards, the user will receive double the amount requested

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < extraRewards.length; ++i) {
            IExtraRewarder(extraRewards[i]).withdraw(account, amount);
        }
```

1. Assume `DV_REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` had mistakenly added the same address twice in `addExtraReward()`.
2. A user calls stake() , linked rewards is staked twice to the same address (unexpected behaviour I guess but not severe issue)
3. Now, user calls withdraw() to withdraw linked rewards (this is already 2x in step 2)
4. User will receive double the linked rewards due to the iteration in the for loop shown above.


## Impact

Due to a misconfiguration error, a leak of value can happen, and other depositors (late withdrawers) would lose the rewards that they are entitled to.
