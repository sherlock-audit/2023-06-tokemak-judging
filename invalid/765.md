# All ERC20 tokens in the LMPVaultRouter.sol will be drained
## Summary
PeripheryPayments.sol contract is a parent contract to LMPVaultRouter.sol. The PeripheryPayments.sol exposes a vulnerable `approve()` function that can be used to approve any address to spend any tokens on the contract. 
```solidity
function approve(IERC20 token, address to, uint256 amount) public payable {
        token.safeApprove(to, amount);//@audit-issue approve myself and withdraw.
    }
```
## Vulnerability Detail
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/utils/PeripheryPayments.sol#L35

1.  An attacker calls the `approve()` function on the LMPVaultRouter.sol(inherited from PeripheryPayments.sol)
```solidity
function approve(IERC20 token, address to, uint256 amount) public payable {
        token.safeApprove(to, amount);//@audit-issue approve myself and withdraw.
    }
```
2. Attacker calls the `transferFrom()` function of the above `token` to transfer all the tokens to the attacker's address.
3. Attacker repeats the first and second steps for any token on LMPVaultRouter.sol to drain all ERC20 tokens on it.

## Impact
All ERC20 tokens on LMPVaultRouter.sol can be drained by an attacker because of the inherited `approve()` function in the PeripheryPayments.sol contract.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function approve(IERC20 token, address to, uint256 amount) public payable {
        token.safeApprove(to, amount);//@audit-issue approve myself and withdraw.
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add access control to the `approve()` function of PeripheryPayments.sol contract.
