# Early depositor can manipulate exchange rate and steal funds
## Summary
The first depositor can mint a very small number of shares, then donate assets to the Vault.
Thereby he manipulates the exchange rate and later depositors lose funds due to rounding down in the number of shares they receive.

## Vulnerability Detail
ERC4626 vaults are subject to a share price manipulation attack that allows an attacker to steal underlying tokens from other depositors:

1. Alice is the first depositor of the vault;
2. Alice deposits 1 wei of token A;
3. In the deposit function, the amount of shares is calculated using the deposit function:
4. Since Alice is the first depositor (totalSupply is 0), she gets 1 share (1 wei);
5. Alice then sends 9999999999999999999 token A (10e18 - 1) to the vault;
6. the price of 1 share is 10 token A now: Alice is the only depositor in the vault, she's holding 1 wei of shares, and the balance of the pool is 10 token A;
7. Bob deposits 19 token A and gets only 1 share due to the rounding in the convertToShares function: 19e18 * 1 / 10e18 == 1;
8. Alice redeems her share and gets a half of the deposited assets, 14.5 tokens;
9. Bob redeems his share and gets only 14.5 amount of token, instead of the 19 tokens he deposited.

## Impact
The attacker can steal funds from later depositors.
