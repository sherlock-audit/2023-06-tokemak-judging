# REVERT IF CALLER OF THE FUNCTION WITH `onlyWhitelisted()` MODIFIER HAS NOT `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` AND NOT WHITELISTED.
## Summary
Function with `onlyWhitelisted()` modifier will revert due to condition in modifier that caller must have 2 roles at the same time instead of 1 as says in the comments.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `AbstractRewarder.sol` contract in natSpec comments to `onlyWhitelisted()` modifier says `"@notice Restricts access to whitelisted addresses or holders of the liquidator role."`, but due to `&&` the caller of the function with `onlyWhitelisted()` modifier must be whitelisted and has `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` at the same time. So it's impossible to pass with one condition as says in comments.

```solidity
/// @notice Restricts access to whitelisted addresses or holders of the liquidator role.
    modifier onlyWhitelisted() {
        if (!whitelistedAddresses[msg.sender] && !_hasRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
            revert Errors.AccessDenied();
        }
        _;
    }
```
## Impact
Caller can't use function with `onlyWhitelisted()` modifier.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace `&&` by `||`.

```solidity
/// @notice Restricts access to whitelisted addresses or holders of the liquidator role.
    modifier onlyWhitelisted() {
        if (!whitelistedAddresses[msg.sender] || !_hasRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
            revert Errors.AccessDenied();
        }
        _;
    }
```
