# Potential Duplicate Token Registration which can't be deleted in `CustomSetOracle` Contract
## Summary
The `CustomSetOracle` contract has a vulnerability that allows the potential duplicate registration of tokens, leading to inconsistent behavior and potential data corruption.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_registerTokens` function of the `CustomSetOracle` contract, there is a missing check to prevent duplicate registration or update of tokens. The function is responsible for registering tokens along with their maximum allowable ages. It has an `allowUpdate` parameter that, when set to true, permits updating the `maxAge` value for tokens that have not been registered before. This design flaw creates a situation where the same token can be registered multiple times with different `maxAge` values.
```solidity
function _registerTokens(address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory maxAges, bool allowUpdate) private {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; ++i) {
        address token = tokens[i];

        uint256 currentAge = prices[token].maxAge;
        if (!allowUpdate && currentAge > 0) {
            revert AlreadyRegistered(token);
        }
        if (allowUpdate && currentAge == 0) {
            revert TokenNotRegistered(token);
        }

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```
In this code, the lack of a comprehensive check to prevent duplicate registration or update can lead to unexpected behavior. For example:

- If a token is mistakenly registered multiple times, it will have different `maxAge` values in the contract state.
- Inconsistencies between `maxAge` values could result in incorrect price calculations or unexpected behavior in applications using this oracle.
When there are duplicate tokens, the function will only be able to unregister one instance of each token. The duplicates will still remain registered, as the function iterates through the list of tokens and removes the token from the prices mapping only once for each unique token address.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that tokens can be erroneously registered multiple times, leading to data inconsistencies and incorrect calculations within the `CustomSetOracle` contract. This can undermine the reliability of the price oracle and cause unexpected behavior in applications that rely on accurate price information.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Add a mapping to the contract to track whether a token has been registered:
```solidity
mapping(address => bool) private registeredTokens;
```
2. Modify the `_registerTokens` function to include checks using the `registeredTokens` mapping:
```solidity
function _registerTokens(address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory maxAges, bool allowUpdate) private {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; ++i) {
        address token = tokens[i];
        bool isRegistered = registeredTokens[token];

        // If token is already registered and allowUpdate is false, revert
        if (!allowUpdate && isRegistered) {
            revert AlreadyRegistered(token);
        }

        // If token is not registered and allowUpdate is true, revert
        if (allowUpdate && !isRegistered) {
            revert TokenNotRegistered(token);
        }

        // Register the token if not already registered
        if (!isRegistered) {
            registeredTokens[token] = true;
        }

        // ... (rest of the logic)
    }

    // ... (emit TokensRegistered event)
}
```
