# In `ConvexRewards.sol`, when `cvxEarned > amountUntilMax`, cvxEarned should be equal to `amountUntilMax`
## Summary
when `cvxEarned > amountUntilMax`, cvxEarned should be equal to `amountUntilMax`

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In ConvexRewards.sol, `getCVXMintAmount()~ is referenced from [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinanceintegration/cvx-minting) for cvx minting, However there seems to be missing below code from same reference,

```Solidity
        if(cvxEarned >  amountTillMax){
            cvxEarned = amountTillMax;
        }
```
