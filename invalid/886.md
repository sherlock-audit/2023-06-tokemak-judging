# Missing `deadline` param in several swap/withdraw functions allowing outdated slippage and allow pending transaction to be executed unexpectedly.
## Summary

Missing `deadline` param in `removeLiquidityComposableImbalance()`, `removeLiquidityImbalance()`, `removeLiquidity()`, `_withdraw()` from `BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol` allowing outdated slippage and allow pending transaction to be executed unexpectedly.

## Vulnerability Detail

Both methods make sure to pass slippage (minimum amount out), but miss to provide the deadline which is crucial to avoid unexpected trades/losses for users and protocol.

Without a deadline, the transaction might be left hanging in the mempool and be executed way later than the user wanted.

That could lead to users/protocol getting a worse price, because a validator can just hold onto the transaction. And when it does get around to putting the transaction in a block

One part of this change is that PoS block proposers know ahead of time if they're going to propose the next block. The validators and the entire network know who's up to bat for the current block and the next one.

This means the block proposers are known for at least 6 minutes and 24 seconds and at most 12 minutes and 48 seconds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Let users provide a fixed deadline as param, and also never set deadline to `block.timestamp`.
