# BaseAsyncSwapper.sol.swap() need to be payable
## Summary
The `Swap` function in the `BaseAsyncSwapper` contract should be `payable`, otherwise, call to `aggregator.swap` get reverted.

## Vulnerability Detail
One of the Adapters that is responsible to process swap through aggregator is `ZeroEx`. As the [ZeroEx docs](https://0x.org/docs/0x-swap-api/guides/use-0x-api-liquidity-in-your-smart-contracts#payable-fallback) state: `Certain quotes require a protocol fee, in ETH, to be attached to the swap call.`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/test/liquidators/ZeroExAdapter.t.sol

But the `BaseAsyncSwapper.sol.swap` is not `payable` and no `ETH` is attached on the `AGGREGATOR.call(swapParams.data)` transaction.

```solidity
        (bool success,) = AGGREGATOR.call(swapParams.data);

        if (!success) {
            revert SwapFailed();
        } 
```
Further, according to [ZeroEx docs](https://0x.org/docs/0x-swap-api/guides/use-0x-api-liquidity-in-your-smart-contracts#payable-fallback) state: `But it's possible that by the time the transaction is mind, the swap will end up not needing to pay the protocol fee. In these cases, the protocol fee would be refunded to the taker, which is in this case is the SimpleTokenSwap contract. So it's important that your contract be able to receive this ETH through either a payable fallback() or receive() function.`

So `BaseAsyncSwapper` contract, need to implement receive() function in order to receive un-used fees.
```solidity
// Payable fallback to allow this contract to receive protocol fee refunds.
receive() external payable {}
```

## Impact
Call to the `BaseAsyncSwapper.sol.swap()` will get reverted and liquidation process will not get done. this can lead to token's get stuck in the `LiquidationRow.sol`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Change `BaseAsyncSwapper.sol.swap()` to be `payable` 
2. Attach `ETH` to the `AGGREGATOR.call(swapParams.data)` transaction
3. Add `receive()` function in the `BaseAsyncSwapper.sol` contract
4. Transfer any leftover `ETH (protocol fee refunds)` to the caller
