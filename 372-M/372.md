# Attempts to price Curve stETH/ETH ng LP tokens with reentrancy check will revert
## Summary
Calls to ``getPriceInEth`` for the Curve stETH/ETH ng LP token with ``poolInfo.checkReentrancy == 1`` will revert due to this specific pool not having an ``owner()`` getter.

## Vulnerability Detail
Tokemak plans to integrate with the Curve stETH/ETH ng pool at the address [0x21E27a5E5513D6e65C4f830167390997aA84843a](https://etherscan.io/address/0x21E27a5E5513D6e65C4f830167390997aA84843a)(a proxy contract). Prices for the corresponding LP token are expected to be obtained through the ``CurveV1StableEthOracle`` contract's ``getPriceInEth`` function (via ``RootPriceOracle``) which loops through the addresses of all tokens in the pool (stETH, ETH) to find the minimum price. If a token is native ETH (``CURVE_REGISTRY_ETH_ADDRESS`` - as in this case) and ``checkReentrancy`` is enabled for the pool (which should generally be the case), ``withdraw_admin_fees`` is called from ``pool.owner()`` to trigger a non-reentrant function to detect read-only reentrancy into the Curve pool. However, a public ``owner()`` getter does not exist on the contract at the stETH/ETH ng pool address, so the call will revert. 
(Note that the implementation behind the proxy has defined ``withdraw_admin_fees``, but without the ``non_reentrant`` modifier, and that the ``CurveV2CryptoEthOracle`` contract can't be used since the pool does not have ``claim_admin_fees`` defined).
A similar issue exists for the ``CurveV1PoolRebasingStatsCalculator``.

## Impact
Attempts to price the stETH/ETH ng LP token will revert. Multiple interactions involving the DestinationVault abstracting the Curve stETH/ETH ng pool will be bricked including withdraw/redeem and rebalancing due to the need to retrieve the LMPVault's current debt value via ``debtValue``.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using a different non_reentrant function to check for read-only reentrancy that is consistent among all V1 pools ([example from MakerDao](https://github.com/makerdao/curve-lp-oracle/blob/master/src/CurveLPOracle.sol#L230)).
