# `mint` and `deposit` will fail for `LMPVaultRouter` is allowance on base asset is already set for `LMPVault`
## Summary

The `LMPVaultRouter` contract uses `SafeERC20.safeApprove` to set the allowance of the `LMPVault` contract on the `baseAsset` token when `mint` or `approve` are called. However, it does not check if allowance is set to 0 before calling `safeApprove`, which might be the case.

## Vulnerability Detail

Minting and depositing in `LMPVault` is expected to be done through the `mint` and the `deposit` function of the `LMPVaultRouter` contract. Both functions use `SafeERC20.safeApprove` to set the allowance of the `LMPVault` contract on the `baseAsset` token. As stated in the comments of the `safeApprove` function, this function requires the current allowance to be set to 0 before setting the new allowance.

```solidity
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
        require(
            (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );
```

However, the `LMPVaultRouter` contract does not guarantee that the allowance is set to 0 before calling `safeApprove`, which might be the case, as this contract has a public function, inherited from `PeripheryPayments.sol`, that allows anyone to set a new approval.

```solidity
    function approve(IERC20 token, address to, uint256 amount) public payable {
        token.safeApprove(to, amount);
    }
```

## Impact

Calls to `mint` and `deposit` might fail if the allowance is not set to 0 before calling `safeApprove`. To avoid front-running, the caller must set the allowance to 0 in the same transaction, before calling `mint` or `deposit`. Some users might not be aware or have the technical knowledge to do so. But what is more important, protocols might not implement this extra requirement in their code and not be able to `mint` or `deposit` in `LMPVault`.


## Proof of Concept

Add the following code to `test/vault/LMPVaultRouter.t.sol` and run `forge test -vv --mt test_safeAllowanceFails`.

```solidity
    function test_safeAllowanceFails_deposit() public {
        uint256 amount = depositAmount;
        baseAsset.approve(address(lmpVaultRouter), amount);

        // Someone sets 1 wei allowance for lmpVault on baseAsset
        lmpVaultRouter.approve(baseAsset, address(lmpVault), 1);

        _deposit(lmpVault, amount);
    }

    function test_safeAllowanceFails_mint() public {
        uint256 amount = depositAmount;
        baseAsset.approve(address(lmpVaultRouter), amount * 2);

        // Someone sets 1 wei allowance for lmpVault on baseAsset
        lmpVaultRouter.approve(baseAsset, address(lmpVault), 1);

        _mint(lmpVault, amount);
    }
```

Console output:
```shell
[FAIL. Reason: SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance] test_safeAllowanceFails_deposit() (gas: 115745)
[FAIL. Reason: SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance] test_safeAllowanceFails_mint() (gas: 124549)
```

## Recommendation

Use `LibAdapter._approve` instead of using `SafeERC20.safeApprove` directly.
