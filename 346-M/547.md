# Anyone can DOS `LMPVaultRouter` by exploiting `safeApprove` public function
## Summary

The `LMPVaultRouter` has a public function called `approve()` from `PeripheryPayments` which uses OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()`.
`safeApprove()` is deprecated and can lead to revert if token allowance isn't zero.
Anyone can change router ERC20 allowance to non-zero value and halt all the router's operations.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is information about `safeApprove()` from OpenZeppelin

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Deprecated. This function has issues similar to the ones found in
     * {IERC20-approve}, and its usage is discouraged.
     *
     * Whenever possible, use {safeIncreaseAllowance} and
     * {safeDecreaseAllowance} instead.
     */
    function safeApprove(
        IERC20 token,
        address spender,
        uint256 value
    ) internal {
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
        require(
            (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0), //@audit allowance must be zero to use safeApprove
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
    }
```

Anyone can call `PeripheryPayments.approve()` [to set allowance to non-zero value](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/utils/PeripheryPayments.sol#L34-L36). This will cause all function in `LMPVaultRouter` to revert as it can't use `safeApprove` anymore.

## Impact

Anyone can DOS `LMPVaultRouter` by calling `PeripheryPayments.approve()` to set allowance to non-zero value.

## Recommendation

Switch to OpenZeppelin's `safeIncreaseAllowance` in place of `safeApprove()`.
