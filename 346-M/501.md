# DoS of `mint()`, `deposit()`, `approve()` and functions that depend on them in `LMPVaultRouter` and inherited contracts
## Summary
`SafeERC20.safeApprove()`, used in the `LMPVaultRouter` and inherited contracts, when setting approvals, reverts if the previous allowance is non null, leading to DoS of `mint()`, `deposit()`, `approve()` and dependent functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
`safeApprove()` of `SafeERC20` [reverts if the current allowance is non null](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/0457042d93d9dfd760dbaa06a4d2f1216fdbe297/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L55). Openzeppelin recommends only using `safeApprove()` [when setting an initial allowance or setting to 0](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/0457042d93d9dfd760dbaa06a4d2f1216fdbe297/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L51-L53).

This can be used by attackers to DoS users calling the following functions (which all depend on `safeApprove()`):

**`LMPVaultRouter`**
- [`withdrawToDeposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouter.sol#L36)
- [`swapAndDepositToVault()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouter.sol#L59)
- [`redeemToDeposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouter.sol#L72)
- [`depositMax()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouter.sol#L86)

**`LMPVaultRouterBase()`**
- [`mint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L35)
- [`deposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L56)

**`PeripheryPayments`**
- [`approve()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/utils/PeripheryPayments.sol#L36)

## Impact
- A temporary DoS in a yield bearing vault might lead to loss of yield, either due to not picking up rewards or the price of an asset of a destination vault decreasing and users not being able to withdraw to prevent further losses.
- Gas griefing, at a much higher cost for the victims than the attacker.
- Temporary DoS

## Code Snippet
Add the following test to `LMPVaultRouter.t.sol` as an example of this issue:
```solidity
function test_POC_ApprovalDoS() public {
    uint256 amount = depositAmount;

    lmpVaultRouter.approve(baseAsset, address(lmpVault), 1);

    baseAsset.approve(address(lmpVaultRouter), amount);

    vm.expectRevert("SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance");
    lmpVaultRouter.deposit(lmpVault, address(this), amount, 1);
}
```
The approval can be set back to 0 by calling `approve()` with a 0 amount, but the attack can be performed again. Additionally, the gas cost of performing the attack is much lower than the gas cost of `withdrawToDeposit()`, for example, which could require withdrawing the base asset from destination vaults, which is a very expensive operation (it would only revert after the `withdraw()` call, spending all the gas used prior to the revert location in [`_deposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L66)).

## Recommendation
The most robust option is using [`forceApprove()`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L76), which was introduced at a more recent version than the current reference one in the codebase.

Usually `safeIncreaseAllowance()` would work too (in more recent Openzeppelin versions, where [`forceApprove()` is used in `safeIncreaseAllowance()`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L54)), but in this case as there is a permissionless `approve()` function, it could be DoSed by setting the allowance to `type(uint256).max`, causing an [overflow](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/0457042d93d9dfd760dbaa06a4d2f1216fdbe297/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L66).
