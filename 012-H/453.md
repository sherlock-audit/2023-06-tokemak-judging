# queueNewRewards function trying to pull more amount of rewards from liquidator
## Summary
In the `AbstractRewarder` contract's `queueNewRewards()` function, both the existing `queuedRewards` and the new incoming `newRewards` are mistakenly being pulled from the liquidator instead of only pulling `newRewards`.Due to this the `queueNewRewards()` will always revert causing DOS to liquidation process.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. In `queueNewRewards()` function of  `AbstractRewarder` `startingQueuedRewards` is being added to `newRewards` at this [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L239).
2. At the end instead of transfering `startingNewRewards` amount of tokens from user `newRewards` amount of tokens are being which is sum of `queuedRewards` and `newRewards`.



## Impact
1. `queueNewRewards()` will always revert.
2. liquidation of destination vault rewards will always fail.

## Code Snippet

## Proof Of Concept
```solidity
   function test_queueNewRewards_bug() public {
        // Initial setup
        address liquidator = address(100);
        accessController.grantRole(Roles.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE, liquidator);
        uint256 newReward = 100_000_000;
        uint256 newRewardBatch2 = newReward / 10;
        uint256 newRewardBatch3 = newReward / 10;
        uint256 totalRewards = newReward + newRewardBatch2 + newRewardBatch3;

        // Minting required rewardTokens to liquidator
        rewardToken.mint(liquidator,totalRewards);
        
        
        vm.startPrank(liquidator);
        rewardToken.approve(address(rewarder),totalRewards);

        // 1. liquidator queued rewards for the first time
        rewarder.queueNewRewards(newReward);

        // advance the blockNumber by durationInBlock / 2 to simulate that the period is almost finished.
        vm.roll(block.number + durationInBlock / 2);

        // 2. liquidator queued rewards again they are added to queue cuz queuedRatio < newRewardRatio
        rewarder.queueNewRewards(newRewardBatch2);
        
        // 3. Reward queuing fails this time as rewarder attempts to pull both queuedRewards and newRewards from 
        // liquidator, instead of just newRewards.
        vm.expectRevert("ERC20: insufficient allowance");
        rewarder.queueNewRewards(newRewardBatch3);

    }
 ```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
-       IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);
+       IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), startingNewRewards);
```
