# Too many Reward funds are transferred in and the funds are locked
## Summary

Adding bonuses to the queue multiple times will lead to too many bonus funds being transferred in, and the funds will be locked

## Vulnerability Detail

Call queueNewRewards for the first time, set newRewards to 5, and put it in the queue without distribution. At this time, newRewards = 5(As shown in the marked code <---1) ,queuedRewards = 5(As shown in the marked code <---2) , will transfer to 5 through safeTransferFrom(As shown in the marked code <---3), and when adding 5 for the second time, newRewards = 10, will pass safeTransferFrom transfers 10, plus the last transferred 5, a total of 15 is transferred, but the final newRewards is 10

```solidity
    function queueNewRewards(uint256 newRewards) external onlyWhitelisted {
        uint256 startingQueuedRewards = queuedRewards;
        uint256 startingNewRewards = newRewards;

        newRewards += startingQueuedRewards; // <---1

        if (block.number >= periodInBlockFinish) {
            notifyRewardAmount(newRewards);
            queuedRewards = 0;
        } else {
            uint256 elapsedBlock = block.number - (periodInBlockFinish - durationInBlock);
            uint256 currentAtNow = rewardRate * elapsedBlock;
            uint256 queuedRatio = currentAtNow * 1000 / newRewards;

            if (queuedRatio < newRewardRatio) {
                notifyRewardAmount(newRewards);
                queuedRewards = 0;
            } else {
                queuedRewards = newRewards; // <---2
            }
        }

        emit QueuedRewardsUpdated(startingQueuedRewards, startingNewRewards, queuedRewards);

        // Transfer the new rewards from the caller to this contract.
        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards); // <---3
    }
```

## Impact

The function of the reward contract is to send rewards, and the excess assets will be locked in the contract and cannot be used

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Transfer the amount when distributing rewards to avoid excessive transfers
