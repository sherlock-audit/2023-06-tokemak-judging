# `queueNewRewards` contains wrong logic, resulting double transfer
## Summary

`queueNewRewards` contains wrong logic, resulting double transfer

## Vulnerability Detail

There is a storage variable `queuedRewards` which is storing the amount of rewards waiting in the queue to be distributed.

```js
File: AbstractRewarder.sol
60:     /// @notice The amount of rewards waiting in the queue to be distributed.
61:     uint256 public queuedRewards;
```

Initially, the value of `queuedRewards` is set to 0. Subsequently, when the `queueNewRewards` function is called, the amount of newRewards is transferred from the sender (msg.sender) to the contract. In the code snippet provided, at line 253, if the condition `queuedRatio < newRewardRatio` evaluates to false, the value of `queuedRewards` is set to be the same as newRewards. This value of `queuedRewards` is then carried over to the next invocation of the `queueNewRewards` function.

At another instance, within the `queueNewRewards` function, the parameter `newRewards` is augmented with the previous value of `queuedRewards` (line 239).

Ultimately, the value of `newRewards` is used to determine the amount to be transferred from the sender. Consequently, this results in the rewardToken being doubled, encompassing both the newly added rewards (newRewards) as well as the rewards that were previously queued (queuedRewards).

```js
File: AbstractRewarder.sol
235:     function queueNewRewards(uint256 newRewards) external onlyWhitelisted {
236:         uint256 startingQueuedRewards = queuedRewards;
237:         uint256 startingNewRewards = newRewards;
238:
239:         newRewards += startingQueuedRewards;
240:
241:         if (block.number >= periodInBlockFinish) {
242:             notifyRewardAmount(newRewards);
243:             queuedRewards = 0;
244:         } else {
245:             uint256 elapsedBlock = block.number - (periodInBlockFinish - durationInBlock);
246:             uint256 currentAtNow = rewardRate * elapsedBlock;
247:             uint256 queuedRatio = currentAtNow * 1000 / newRewards;
248:
249:             if (queuedRatio < newRewardRatio) {
250:                 notifyRewardAmount(newRewards);
251:                 queuedRewards = 0;
252:             } else {
253:                 queuedRewards = newRewards;
254:             }
255:         }
256:
257:         emit QueuedRewardsUpdated(startingQueuedRewards, startingNewRewards, queuedRewards);
258:
259:         // Transfer the new rewards from the caller to this contract.
260:         IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);
261:     }
```

The potential issue here is that the `newRewards` value used for the token transfer has been modified by adding startingQueuedRewards to it. This means that the contract might transfer more tokens than intended if queuedRewards was not 0 when the function was called.

## Impact

queueNewRewards might transfer more tokens than intended if queuedRewards was not 0 when the function was called

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Fix the logic, revise the variable and make sure the transfer new rewards from the caller to the contract is correct amount by fixing the line 239, either using another temporary value to cache the `newRewards`
