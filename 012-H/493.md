# `AbstractRewarder::queueNewRewards` may transfer too much from the msg.sender and the surplus will be trapped
## Summary


When some rewards are already queued to the `AbstractRewarder`, the `AbstractRewarder::queueNewRewards` function will try to transfer the `queuedRewards` on top of the `newRewards` from the msg.sender. The surplus will not be accounted, therefore will be simply trapped in the rewarder.

## Vulnerability Detail


```solidity
// AbstractRewarder
235     function queueNewRewards(uint256 newRewards) external onlyWhitelisted {
236         uint256 startingQueuedRewards = queuedRewards;
237         uint256 startingNewRewards = newRewards;
238
239         newRewards += startingQueuedRewards;
...
259         // Transfer the new rewards from the caller to this contract.
260       IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);   
```

In the `AbstractRewarder::queueNewRewards`, the parameter `newRewards` is the amount of the new rewards to be added.
When some rewards are already queued, the storage variable `queuedRewards` is non-zero, and it is added to the `newRewards` in the line 239.
In the line 260, the updated `newRewards` amount is transferred from the msg.sender to the rewarder itself.
So, at the end the `queuedReward` is the surplus transferred on top of the `newRewards`.
Since the surplus is not accounted, it will be simply trapped and it cannot be rescued.

## Impact

If there is already some queued rewards and another new rewards are added on top of the queued rewards,
the rewarder will transfer the newly added rewards plus the amount of the existing queued rewards from the msg.sender.
The surplus from the msg.sender is locked in the rewarder and it cannot be rescued.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Transfer the `startingNewRewards` instead of the `newRewards`

```solidity
237         uint256 startingNewRewards = newRewards;
238
239         newRewards += startingQueuedRewards;
...
259         // Transfer the new rewards from the caller to this contract.
- 260       IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);   
+           IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), startingNewRewards);   
```
