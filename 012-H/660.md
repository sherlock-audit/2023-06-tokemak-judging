# Wrong approvals causes Complete Denial of Service of Liquidation Process
## Summary
In `_performLiquidation` function of `LiquidationRow.sol`, before queuing of rewards , "amount" number of tokens are approved . But in `queueNewRewards` function of `AbstractRewarder.sol`, this "amount" is increased by the "queuedRewards"(i.e., amount +queuedRewards)  which would require approval of "amount + queuedRewards". But as we know approval was given only for "amount" number of tokens , causing failure of the process .
## Vulnerability Detail
In `_performLiquidation` function of `LiquidationRow.sol` ,  we can see an approval of "amount" number of tokens is given to the rewarder contract :
```solidity
            // approve main rewarder to pull the tokens
            LibAdapter._approve(IERC20(params.buyTokenAddress), address(mainRewarder), amount);
            mainRewarder.queueNewRewards(amount);
```
Then in the `queueNewRewards` function of rewarder contract , the "newRewards"(which is same as "amount" number of tokens) is added with  "queuedRewards".
```solidity
        uint256 startingQueuedRewards = queuedRewards;
        uint256 startingNewRewards = newRewards;

        newRewards += startingQueuedRewards;
```
Then in the upcoming step, the Rewarder contract tries to pull "amount" + "queuedRewards" number of tokens from `LiquidationRow.sol` which would revert as the approval is only given for "amount" number of tokens and not for "amount" + "queuedRewards" number of tokens.
```solidity
IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);
```
## Impact
Complete Denial of Service of the Liquidation process on presence of "queuedRewards".

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a new `getqueuedRewards()` view function in the AbstractRewarder.sol contract which would return the `queuedRewards` state. It could be called by `_performLiquidation` function of `LiquidationRow.sol` and the `queuedRewards` can be added to the "amount" variable before approving.
