# AbstractRewarder.queueNewRewards() will transfer ``(newRewards + queuedRewards)`` instead of ``newRewards`` reward tokens, as a result, the extra ``queuedRewards`` tokens will not be accounted and  lost to the contract forever.
## Summary
``AbstractRewarder.queueNewRewards()`` will transfer ``(newRewards + queuedRewards)`` instead of ``newRewards`` reward tokens, as a result, the extra ``queuedRewards`` tokens will not be accounted and lost to the contract forever. The main reason is that the value of ``newRewards`` has been changed to ``newRewards+queuedRewards`` and the line ``IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);`` will transfer additional ``queuedRewards`` reward tokens to the contract. The correct value to use is ``startingNewRewards``, which is the initial input value of ``newRewards``. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The  ``AbstractRewarder.queueNewRewards()`` function allows authorized user to add new rewards to the contract for distribution in the amount of ``newRewards``.

[https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L235-L260C1](https://github.com/Tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/blob/62445b8ee3365611534c96aef189642b721693bf/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L235-L260C1)

Unfortunately, while internal accounting consider that reward tokens in the amount of the initial value of ``newRewards`` have been transferred to the contract, the actual amount of transferred reward tokens is ``queuedRewards + newRewards`` since ``newRewards``  has been assigned with the new value of ``queuedRewards + newRewards``  at L239. As a result, at L260, instead of using variable ``startingNewRewards`` - the initial value of ``newRewards``, it uses the updated value of ``newRewards``, then the total amount of reward tokens is  ``queuedRewards + newRewards``, which is ``queuedRewards`` more than the intended one. 

Example: suppose ``queuedRewards = 1000e18" and ``newRewards = 10e18". While we expect to transfer 10e18 reward tokens to the contract and also does such accounting, the actual transferred amount would be 1010e18 reward tokens, way much more than what is expected. 

## Impact
Since extra reward tokens will be sent to the contract but will not be accounted and used, they will be lost in the contract forever. Loss of funds.

## Recommendation
We should use the initial value of ``newRewards`` to transfer the tokens. 

```diff
 function queueNewRewards(uint256 newRewards) external onlyWhitelisted {
        uint256 startingQueuedRewards = queuedRewards;
        uint256 startingNewRewards = newRewards;

        newRewards += startingQueuedRewards;

        if (block.number >= periodInBlockFinish) {
            notifyRewardAmount(newRewards);
            queuedRewards = 0;
        } else {
            uint256 elapsedBlock = block.number - (periodInBlockFinish - durationInBlock);
            uint256 currentAtNow = rewardRate * elapsedBlock;
            uint256 queuedRatio = currentAtNow * 1000 / newRewards;

            if (queuedRatio < newRewardRatio) {
                notifyRewardAmount(newRewards);
                queuedRewards = 0;
            } else {
                queuedRewards = newRewards;
            }
        }

        emit QueuedRewardsUpdated(startingQueuedRewards, startingNewRewards, queuedRewards);

        // Transfer the new rewards from the caller to this contract.
-        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);
+       IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), startingNewRewards);
 
    }

```
