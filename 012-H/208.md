# The queueNewRewards function does not correctly allocate funds
## Summary

The [queueNewRewards function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L235) of the AbstractRewarder contract can be utilized by approved addresses to queue rewards that will be distributed to stakers. However, the function's logic does not correctly allocate the reward funds. Each time this function is invoked, the currently [queued rewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L236) are [added](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L239) to the `newRewards` parameter value.  This is problematic because the sender will then have to [transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L260) the amount of rewardTokens equal to the `newRewards` value plus the `queuedRewards` value each time the function is invoked.

## Vulnerability Detail

Because the [`queuedRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L236) amount is added to the [`newRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L239) amount, the sender will have to [transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L260)  an amount equal to the currently queued rewards plus the amount that was provided as the `newRewards` parameter.

## Impact

This will cause a substantial amount of funds to be under-allocated and locked in the contract because there is no functionality in place to remove locked tokens. Additionally, because a user will have to transfer the value of the currently queued rewards plus the value that they would like to increase the amount by, the price of increasing the `queuedRewards` amount, effectively, exponentially increases with each invocation of the function which will likely constrain the queued reward amounts from increasing by too much. Beyond the loss of funds from the under-allocation, this will have a direct implication on the protocol in that the, likely, low staking rewards that will result from this will disincentivize users from wanting to use the  protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to refactor the [queueNewRewards function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L235) so that only the amount initially specified as the `newRewards` parameter is transferred to the contract. This can be done by updating the amount parameter that is passed to the [safeTransferFrom](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L260C73-L260C83) invocation to the [startingQueuedRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#L236) variable as shown below:
```solidity
    function queueNewRewards(uint256 newRewards) external onlyWhitelisted {
        uint256 startingQueuedRewards = queuedRewards;
        uint256 startingNewRewards = newRewards;

        newRewards += startingQueuedRewards;

        if (block.number >= periodInBlockFinish) {
            notifyRewardAmount(newRewards);
            queuedRewards = 0;
        } else {
            uint256 elapsedBlock = block.number - (periodInBlockFinish - durationInBlock);
            uint256 currentAtNow = rewardRate * elapsedBlock;
            uint256 queuedRatio = currentAtNow * 1000 / newRewards;

            if (queuedRatio < newRewardRatio) {
                notifyRewardAmount(newRewards);
                queuedRewards = 0;
            } else {
                queuedRewards = newRewards;
            }
        }

        emit QueuedRewardsUpdated(startingQueuedRewards, startingNewRewards, queuedRewards);

        // Transfer the new rewards from the caller to this contract.
        //  @audit recommended mitigation
        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), startingNewRewards);
    }
```
As an additional precaution, it is recommended to implement an access controlled function that approved users can use to transfer tokens from the contract so that funds are not permanently lost. The following is a possible implementation of this:
```solidity
    // @audit recommended mitigation
    function recover(
        address tokenAddress,
        address destination,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(destination, amount);
    }
```
