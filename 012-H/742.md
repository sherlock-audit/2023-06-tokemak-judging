# Lost funds in Reward Distribution Process
## Summary
When the rewarder has already tokens for distribution queued, and more reward tokens get distributed, then a higher than expected amount of tokens is transfered from the sender (liquidator), resulting in either lost funds, or a broken liquidation / reward distribution process due to a revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `queueNewRewards(uint256)` in the contract `AbstractRewarder.sol` is used to queue tokens for reward distribution. The new tokens can either be directly send to distribution, or can be queued for a later distribution, if some certain condition is met - the _newRewardRatio_. In the latter case, the new token amount gets added to the _queuedRewards_ storage variable.

Early in the function, we see the following lines:
```solidity
uint256 startingQueuedRewards = queuedRewards;
(..)
newRewards += startingQueuedRewards;
```
Here the new tokens get added to the old queued token amount, to later perform the calculation for the _newRewardRatio_.

At the end of the function, the newly added tokens are transfered from the sender to the rewarder:
`IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);`

We see here, that the _newRewards_ value is used, which includes not only the newly added tokens, but also the old queued ones. Therefore a higher than expected amount is transfered.


The following test/POC demonstrates this behaviour:
```solidity
    function test_QueueNewRewards_RewarderSendsTooManyTokens() public {
        console.log("=== Before any rewards - starting conditions ===");
        console.log("currentRewards: ", rewarder.currentRewards());
        console.log("Queue Rewards: ", rewarder.queuedRewards());
        console.log("NewRewardRatio: ", rewarder.newRewardRatio());
        console.log("RewardToken balance of rewarder: ", rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
        console.log("RewardToken balance of liquidator: ", rewardToken.balanceOf(address(liquidator)));
        console.log("");

        vm.prank(liquidator);
        rewarder.queueNewRewards(100000000);

        console.log("=== First round of rewards were queued ===");
        console.log("currentRewards: ", rewarder.currentRewards());
        console.log("Queue Rewards: ", rewarder.queuedRewards());
        console.log("NewRewardRatio: ", rewarder.newRewardRatio());
        console.log("RewardToken balance of rewarder: ", rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
        console.log("RewardToken balance of liquidator: ", rewardToken.balanceOf(address(liquidator)));
        console.log("");

        vm.roll(block.number + durationInBlock / 2);

        console.log("=== Rolling forward half the reward time ===");
        console.log("currentRewards: ", rewarder.currentRewards());
        console.log("Queue Rewards: ", rewarder.queuedRewards());
        console.log("NewRewardRatio: ", rewarder.newRewardRatio());
        console.log("RewardToken balance of rewarder: ", rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
        console.log("RewardToken balance of liquidator: ", rewardToken.balanceOf(address(liquidator)));
        console.log("");

        vm.prank(liquidator);
        rewarder.queueNewRewards(100);

        console.log("=== After second round of rewards ===");
        console.log("=== 100 tokens will be queued for distribution  ===");
        console.log("currentRewards: ", rewarder.currentRewards());
        console.log("Queue Rewards: ", rewarder.queuedRewards());
        console.log("NewRewardRatio: ", rewarder.newRewardRatio());
        console.log("RewardToken balance of rewarder: ", rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
        console.log("RewardToken balance of liquidator: ", rewardToken.balanceOf(address(liquidator)));
        console.log();

        vm.prank(liquidator);
        rewarder.queueNewRewards(100);

        console.log("=== Another round of rewards - 100 more tokens will be queued for distribution again ===");
        console.log("=== 100 tokens are newly added for distribution, for a total of 200 queued tokens");
        console.log("=== But 200 tokens will be transfered  from the liquidator! ===");
        console.log("currentRewards: ", rewarder.currentRewards());
        console.log("Queue Rewards: ", rewarder.queuedRewards());
        console.log("NewRewardRatio: ", rewarder.newRewardRatio());
        console.log("RewardToken balance of rewarder: ", rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
        console.log("RewardToken balance of liquidator: ", rewardToken.balanceOf(address(liquidator)));
        console.log();
    }
```

It should be placed in the `QueueNewRewards` test contract in the `AbstractRewarder.t.sol` test file. (`forge-std/console.sol` must also be added to the imports for the console output.)
When run, this is the output:

## Impact
The protocol will either lose funds (as they get stuck in the rewarder, which has no way to recover them), or the liquidation/reward distribution process breaks due to a revert of the transfer (in case of insufficient funds of the liquidator). 


## Code Snippet

    function queueNewRewards(uint256 newRewards) external onlyWhitelisted {
        uint256 startingQueuedRewards = queuedRewards;
        (..)
        newRewards += startingQueuedRewards;
        (..)
        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The transfer function should use the _startingNewRewards_ variable, instead of the _newRewards_ one:
IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), startingNewRewards);
