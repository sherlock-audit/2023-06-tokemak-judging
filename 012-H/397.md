# LiquidationRow's `queueNewRewards` does not work due to double spending of `queueNewRewards`.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

`queueNewRewards` is distributed only after a certain amount of rewards have accumulated.
Hence the existence of `queuedRewards`. `newRewards` is the sum of this new reward and the previous `queuedRewards`.
```solidity
newRewards += startingQueuedRewards;
```

At the end, receive from `msg.sender` `newRewards`, which is the sum of the `queuedRewards`, so we have to pay again even though we have already paid.
```solidity
IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);
```


For a `LiquidationRow` calling `queueNewRewards`
scenario:
If rewardToken = WETH
1. queue 1 WETH for reward : queueNewRewards(1 WETH) ⇒ queued
2. transfer 1 WETH to rewarder : WETH.transferFrom(LiquidationRow, Rewarder, 1 WETH)
3. queue 2 WETH for reward : queueNewRewards(2 WETH) ⇒ execute
4. newReward will 3 WETH. (newReward = 2 WETH + queuedREwards)
5. transfer 2 + 1 WETH to rewarder : WETH.transferFrom(LiquidationRow, Rewarder, 3 WETH)

This causes a revert because the `LiquidationRow` only approves the amount.

If a regular EOA had been called, a total of 4 WETH would have been required to provide a reward of 3 WETH, which is unrecoverable.

## Impact
LiquidationRow's `queueNewRewards` will not work after the reward is queued.

## Recommendation
Call `transferFrom` except for `queuedRewards`.
