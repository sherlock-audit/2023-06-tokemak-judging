# Some amount of rewards can stuck in the contract
## Summary
If there is no deposit for sometime in start then reward for those period is never used

## Vulnerability Detail
queueNewRewards function queues the specified amount of new rewards for distribution to stakers. If this function called for the first time following if statement will be used. Subsequently notifyRewardAmount() will be called

Consider following example:
1. Admin has added reward which made reward rate as 50 reward per block                       
```solidity
        rewardRate = reward / durationInBlock;
```
2. For initial 40 blocks there were no deposits which means total supply was 0
3. So no reward were distributed for initial 40 blocks and reward for this duration which is 50*40=2000 will remain in contract
4. Since on notifying contract of new rewards, these stuck rewards are not considered so these 2000 rewards will remain in contract with no usage

## Impact
Tokens can stuck in the contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider defining periodFinish in the first stake() that is done after notifyRewardAmount(), when total deposits are zero
