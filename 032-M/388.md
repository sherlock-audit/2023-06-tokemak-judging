# Lost rewards if everyone withdraws from the underlying `StakeTracker` (due to a vulnerability or other reason)
## Summary
The original [Convex implementation](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/cvxRewardPool.sol) had no method to unqueue rewards, but it was a standalone smart contract. In this case, `MainRewarder` and `ExtraRewarder` depend on the `StakeTracker` contract, which is either a `DestinationVault` or `LMPVault`, much more complex systems. This means that in case all users withdraw from these vaults (possibly from a vulnerability, which would make it dangerous to deposit), all the leftover rewards would be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `MainRewarder` and `ExtraRewarder` are coupled to the `StakeTracker` ([`LMPVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L834C5-L865) and [`DestinationVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L335-L353)), such that tokens are automatically withdrawn and staked on transfer.

The rewarders have the functionality to queue rewards, which triggers the destribution of rewards over time, at a constant pace (`rewardRate`).

As the rewarders are strongly dependent on the `StakeTrackers`, they should have some protection in case the `StakeTracker` contract has a vulnerability (or the `totalSupply()` is `0`, which causes no reward accrual #4).

However, the current implementation does not allow rewards to be unqueued, leading to possibly lost tokens.

## Impact
Lost rewards if the underlying `StakeTracker` malfunctions or the `totalSupply()` is `0`.

## Code Snippet
`_beforeTokenTransfer()` and `_afterTokenTransfer()` in the `DestinationVault`:
```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
	if (from == to) {
		return;
	}

	if (from != address(0)) {
		_rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
	}
}

function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
	if (from == to) {
		return;
	}

	if (to != address(0)) {
		_rewarder.stake(to, amount);
	}
}
```

## Recommendation
Add a function to unqueue rewards to protect against stuck rewards which will never be claimed.
