# `feeSink` address should not be subjected to limit
## Summary

The `feeSink` address should not be subjected to `perWalletLimit` as it will cause the rebalancing and update debt report processes to fail, leading to a loss for the shareholders.

## Vulnerability Detail

The fee collected is minted to the `feeSink` address owned by the protocol as shown at Line 823 below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L800

```solidity
File: LMPVault.sol
800:     function _collectFees(uint256 idle, uint256 debt, uint256 totalSupply) internal {
801:         address sink = feeSink;
..SNIP..
815:         if (currentNavPerShare > effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) {
816:             // Even if we aren't going to take the fee (haven't set a sink)
817:             // We still want to calculate so we can emit for off-chain analysis
818:             profit = (currentNavPerShare - effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) * totalSupply;
819:             fees = profit.mulDiv(performanceFeeBps, (MAX_FEE_BPS ** 2), Math.Rounding.Up);
820:             if (fees > 0 && sink != address(0)) {
821:                 // Calculated separate from other mints as normal share mint is round down
822:                 shares = _convertToShares(fees, Math.Rounding.Up);
823:                 _mint(sink, shares);
..SNIP..
```

However, if the `feeSink` address has more than `perWalletLimit` number of shares, the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function below will always revert. This might happen due to accumulating shares over time, or a malicious user can intentionally send some shares to the `feeSink` address.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L834

```solidity
File: LMPVault.sol
834:     function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused {
..SNIP..
847:         // Make sure the destination wallet total share balance doesn't go above the
848:         // current perWalletLimit
849:         if (balanceOf(to) + amount > perWalletLimit) {
850:             revert OverWalletLimit(to);
851:         }
852:     }
```

If the LMPVaults are highly profitable, a large number of shares will always be minted to the `feeSink` address, resulting in the revert being triggered quickly and frequently. If the `perWalletLimit` is small, it will further aggravate the issues.

## Impact

The rebalancing process will fail as it calls the `_collectFees` function internally, resulting in the inability to deploy deposited WETH to external markets.   The `updateDebtReporting` will also fail as it relies on the `_collectFees` function internally, causing the LMPvault not to be able to collect the rewards and the profits not to be recorded. Both will result in a loss for the vault shareholders.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `feeSink` address should be excluded from the `perWalletLimit` since it belongs to the protocol for the purpose of collecting fees.

```diff
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused {
..SNIP..
    // Make sure the destination wallet total share balance doesn't go above the
    // current perWalletLimit
-    if (balanceOf(to) + amount > perWalletLimit) {
+    if (balanceOf(to) + amount > perWalletLimit && to != feeSink) {
        revert OverWalletLimit(to);
    }
}
```
