# perWalletLimit for feeSink may lead to DOS
## Summary
Tokemark's fee collection converts assets to shares and mints to `feeSink` address during triggers like `rebalance()` based on a nav threshold. The perWalletLimit, designed to restrict individual wallet exposure, is wrongly enforced also on the feeSink address. This will cause a revert with an [`OverWalletLimit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L850) error when total shares owned by feeSink address surpasses the perWalletLimit, inadvertently disrupting future `rebalance()`, `flashRebalance()` & `updateDebtReporting()` calls.

## Vulnerability Detail
Tokemark collects fees in assets, which are converted to shares and are minted to feeSink address whenever `rebalance()`, `flashRebalance()` or `updateDebtReporting()` is called and the vault’s net asset value is higher than a certain threshold.

[`LMPVault._collectFees#L815-L825`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L815-L825)
```solidity
        if (currentNavPerShare > effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) {
            // Even if we aren't going to take the fee (haven't set a sink)
            // We still want to calculate so we can emit for off-chain analysis
            profit = (currentNavPerShare - effectiveNavPerShareHighMark) * totalSupply;
            fees = profit.mulDiv(performanceFeeBps, (MAX_FEE_BPS ** 2), Math.Rounding.Up);
            if (fees > 0 && sink != address(0)) {
                // Calculated separate from other mints as normal share mint is round down
                shares = _convertToShares(fees, Math.Rounding.Up);
                _mint(sink, shares);
                emit Deposit(address(this), sink, fees, shares);
            }
```

Tokemark also implements a `perWalletLimit` in order to allow the guarded rollout and limit each individual wallet's exposure.


The problem here is that this perWalletLimit is also applied to the feesink address (fee-collecting address, not an individual user).

As a result, once the protocol has collected more fees such that shares minted to feeSink address are more than `perWalletLimit,` it will always revert in `_beforeTokenTransfer()` with `OverWalletLimit(to)` error as mentioned.

[`LMPVault._beforeTokenTransfer#L834-L851`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L834-L851)


```solidity
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused {
        // Nothing to do really do here
        if (from == to) {
            return;
        }


        // If this isn't a mint of new tokens, then they are being transferred
        // from someone who is "staked" in the rewarder. Make sure they stop earning
        // When they transfer those funds
        if (from != address(0)) {
            rewarder.withdraw(from, amount, true);
        }


        // Make sure the destination wallet total share balance doesn't go above the
        // current perWalletLimit
        if (balanceOf(to) + amount > perWalletLimit) {
            revert OverWalletLimit(to);
        }
    }


```
Essentially reverting all the future `rebalance()`, `flashRebalance()` & `updateDebtReporting()` calls.
## Impact
DOS for rebalancing functionalities, which may result in loss for LMPVault as the solver wont be able to optimize the performance.
