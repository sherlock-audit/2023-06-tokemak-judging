# Router is requiring twice the tokens when paying with native eth
## Summary

LMPRouterBase is allowing to pay in native ETH instead of WETH inside the mint/deposit functions. However the implementation is flawed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `mint` and `deposit` implementation of the `LMPRouterBase` contract allow a user to pay in native eth for vaults that are using `WETH` as an asset.

For this the ` _processEthIn` is called at the beginning of these functions. Inside this function there is a check if the `msg.value` is bigger than `0` and if yes if the vaults asset is `WETH`. In case the second check fails, the function will revert.
However if it is an WETH vault, the msg.value is deposited to weth (wrapping it).
However after the call to ` _processEthIn` the function continues as usual and eventually calls `pullToken`, which is straight up calling `safeTransferFrom` and transferring the specified amount of WETH into the contract. This makes the user actually pay twice, as a part was payed in native eth and again paid in WETH.  


## Impact

User pays twice or transaction reverts (if missing approval)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Adjust the amount to pull from the user in case there was native eth sent.
