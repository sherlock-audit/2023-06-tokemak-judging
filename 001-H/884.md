# `LMPVaultRouterBase::mint` and `LMPVaultRouterBase::deposit` transfer extra assets from the user when ETH is provided
## Summary

`LMPVaultRouterBase::mint` and `LMPVaultRouterBase::deposit` transfer extra assets from the user when ETH is provided

## Vulnerability Detail

When either `LMPVaultRouterBase::mint` or `LMPVaultRouterBase::deposit` are called, `_processEthIn` is called to handle possible ETH.

```solidity
    function deposit(
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minSharesOut
    ) public payable virtual override returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
        // handle possible eth
        _processEthIn(vault);

        IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
        pullToken(vaultAsset, amount, address(this));

        return _deposit(vault, to, amount, minSharesOut);
    }
```

```solidity
    function _processEthIn(ILMPVault vault) internal {
        // if any eth sent, wrap it first
        if (msg.value > 0) {
            // if asset is not weth, revert
            if (address(vault.asset()) != address(weth9)) {
                revert InvalidAsset();
            }

            // wrap eth
            weth9.deposit{ value: msg.value }();
        }
    }
```

The issue is that the vault asset will again be transfered from the user: `pullToken(vaultAsset, amount, address(this));`.
This is double charging the user in the scenario where they had chosen to provide ETH.

## Impact

User is double charged during minting and depositing.

## Recommendation

If ETH is provided, additional assets should not be transfered from the user.
