# User can lost funds when mint() with ETH from LMPVaultRouter
## Summary
When minting with ETH, **LMPVaultRouterBase**'s mint() function also pull WETH from caller if the caller had approved WETH back in some time. 

## Vulnerability Detail
1 - Suppose the ratio in vault is 1:1, Alice wants to mint 1e18 shares, as WETH and ETH are 1:1, so inside mint() of LMPVaultRouterBase ```_processEthIn()``` converts deposited ETH into WETH. The functions will be called with params like below.
```solidity 
mint(wethVaultAddress,userAddress,1e18,1e18)
```
2 - Assuming some users who have WETH and had approved to LMPVaultRouter back in some time. In spite of getting ETH, following line also pulls 1 WETH from user. 
```solidity
        pullToken(vaultAsset, assets, address(this));
```

3 - The user will get shares of 1 ETH, and will lose 1 WETH unknowingly. 

The WETH pulled from user will remain inside the LMPVaultRouter unless someone/BOT calls sweepToken() and gets those WETH.

## Impact

Those users who have WETH in their account and had approved WETH to LMPVaultRouter will lose WETH when minting with ETH.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
   /// @inheritdoc ILMPVaultRouterBase
      function mint(
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 shares,
        uint256 maxAmountIn
    ) public payable virtual override returns (uint256 amountIn) {
        // handle possible eth
        _processEthIn(vault); // @audit

        IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
        uint256 assets = vault.previewMint(shares);
        pullToken(vaultAsset, assets, address(this)); // @audit
        vaultAsset.safeApprove(address(vault), assets);

        amountIn = vault.mint(shares, to);
        if (amountIn > maxAmountIn) {
            revert MaxAmountError();
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only pull WETH from user when msg.value < maxAmountIn.
Make sure to pull the difference between msg.value and maxAmountIn like below:
```solidity
if(msg.value < maxAmountIn){
uint amountToPull = maxAmountIn - msg.value;
pullToken(vaultAsset, amountToPull, address(this));
}
```
