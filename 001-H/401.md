# LMPVaultRouterBase: `mint`, `deposit` will be double-paid when paid with `ETH`, and the excess can be stolen.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
`LMPVaultRouterBase`'s `mint` and `deposit` help users to mint and deposit to the vault with `ETH` or `vaultAsset`.

If the `vaultAsset` is `WETH`, a double payment may occur when the user calls mint and deposit by sending `ETH`.

```solidity
function mint(
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 shares,
        uint256 maxAmountIn
    ) public payable virtual override returns (uint256 amountIn) {
        // handle possible eth
        _processEthIn(vault);

        IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
        uint256 assets = vault.previewMint(shares);
        pullToken(vaultAsset, assets, address(this)); 
        vaultAsset.safeApprove(address(vault), assets); 

        amountIn = vault.mint(shares, to);
        if (amountIn > maxAmountIn) {
            revert MaxAmountError();
        }
    }
```
If a value exists in `msg.value`, the `mint` function wraps it in `WETH` at `_processEthIn`.

It then receives `vaultAsset` as `pullToken` from `msg.sender` as assets.

So the user pays `WETH` even though they already paid with `ETH`.

This succeeds if the user has already authorized `WETH` on the router.

Since `_processWethOut` withdraws all `WETH` from the router, any overpaid `WETH` can be taken by any user via `withdraw`.

## Impact
If call `mint` and `deposit` with `ETH` on the router, user will be double-spent, and the excess can be stolen.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If user paid with `ETH`, should not call `pullToken`.
