# LMPVaultRouterBase: Native ETH lost in router when mint&deposit
## Summary

`LMPVaultRouter` inherits `LMPVaultRouterBase`'s `payable` `mint` and `deposit` functions. The native ETH handling logics in `mint` and `deposit` are faulty.

## Vulnerability Detail

Take `deposit` as example. It calls `_processEthIn` to handle eth values in transaction.

```solidity
    function deposit(
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minSharesOut
    ) public payable virtual override returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
        // handle possible eth
        _processEthIn(vault);

        IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
        pullToken(vaultAsset, amount, address(this));

        return _deposit(vault, to, amount, minSharesOut);
    }
```

`_processEthIn` wraps ETH to WETH. The WETH will be used for LMPVault depositing and is already in router contract.

```solidity
    function _processEthIn(ILMPVault vault) internal {
        // if any eth sent, wrap it first
        if (msg.value > 0) {
            // if asset is not weth, revert
            if (address(vault.asset()) != address(weth9)) {
                revert InvalidAsset();
            }

            // wrap eth
            weth9.deposit{ value: msg.value }();
        }
    }
```

After `_processEthIn`, `pullToken` is called redundantly to pull WETH from user and the LMPVault is using the pulled tokens to deposit underlying. The wrapped ETH in `_processEthIn` is not used and will be left in router.

`mint` in `LMPVaultRouterBase` has the same problem.

## Impact

Native ETH sent by user is not used for minting LMPVault shares and will be left in router contract. The left assets in router can be taken out by anyone.
