# deposits with native ETH are not correctly handled in LMPVaultRouterBase
## Summary
In `LMPVaultRouterBase` contract's `mint` and `deposit` functions contract is trying to pull WETH from user even though the user sends the required amount in native ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. The `mint` and `deposit` functions within the `LMPVaultRouterBase` contract are intended to manage deposits in both native ETH and WETH.
2. If a user provides a deposit in the form of native ETH to these functions, the `_processEthIn()` function converts this native ETH into WETH.
3. However, the router is attempting to pull WETH from the user once again, instead of utilizing the WETH that already exists within the router, which came from the conversion of the user's native ETH.

## Impact
1. users can't use the native ETH for deposits.
2. Or double amount of funds will be taken from user if he also has WETH allowance to router.

## Code Snippet

## Proof Of Concept 
```solidity
function test_mint_with_native_eth() public {

  address user = address(100);
  vm.deal(user,10 ether);

  // Making sure base asset of vault is WETH
  assertEq(lmpVault.asset(),WETH_MAINNET);

  vm.startPrank(user);
  vm.expectRevert("SafeERC20: low-level call failed");
  // User trying to deposit to the vault using native ether
  lmpVaultRouter.deposit{value: 5 ether}(lmpVault,user,5 ether,0);
}
```

## Recommendation
Don't pull WETH from the user when user is trying to deposit using native ETH
