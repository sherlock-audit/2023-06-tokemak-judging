# LMPVaultRouterBase incorrectly handle WETH transfer
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Supplying ETH via `msg.value` doesn't work since native ETH gets wrapped by internal function `_processEthIn` then it will attempt to transfer WETH from user via `pullToken` which result in the assets being transfer twice (both ETH and WETH)

## Impact
Incorrect implementation causes contract to not function properly and initial ETH sent will be stuck in router contract

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        // handle possible eth
        _processEthIn(vault);  // @audit - ETH being wrapped

        IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
        uint256 assets = vault.previewMint(shares);
        pullToken(vaultAsset, assets, address(this));  // @audit - WETH being transferred in
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
skip pull WETH if WETH balance in contract as a result of wrapping is enough for `assets` amount
