# User can loss fund with mint function
## Summary
The user can loss fund if `LMPVaultRouterBase.sol.mint` function get used with `msg.value > 0`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `mint` function in the `LMPVaultRouterBase` contract is using in order to mint exact provided `share` amount from the user for the user and user can pay needed amount of asset with `ETH` or `erc20 Token`. As you can see this function is `payable`. 

```Solidity
    function mint(
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 shares,
        uint256 maxAmountIn
    ) public payable virtual override returns (uint256 amountIn) {
        // handle possible eth
        _processEthIn(vault);

        IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
        uint256 assets = vault.previewMint(shares);
        pullToken(vaultAsset, assets, address(this));
        vaultAsset.safeApprove(address(vault), assets);

        amountIn = vault.mint(shares, to);
        if (amountIn > maxAmountIn) {
            revert MaxAmountError();
        }
    }
```
Assume that the `vaultAsset` is `wETH` and user want to call this function with `msg.value = 1 ETH`. anyone who has approved the contract for `wETH` token, if call this function with for example `msg.value = 1 ETH`, will pay duble cost for this process. first from native ETH that attached to the transaction and next is from `pullToken` function that is called from `PeripheryPayments.sol`.

```solidity
    function pullToken(IERC20 token, uint256 amount, address recipient) public payable {
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
    }
```

A malicious user can steal it with `sweepToken` from `PeripheryPayments.sol`.

## Impact
Anyone who has approved the `LMPVaultRouter.sol` for `wETH` token, If using `mint` function with `msg.value` < `approved value`, then will pay duble cost for this process.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Function should not use `pullToken` if user sent in eth.
