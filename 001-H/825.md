# LMPVaultRouter will charge a user twice and the extra funds can be stolen
## Summary

The LMPVaultRouter will charge a user twice for a deposit or mint to an LMPVault, if the user wants to use ETH. This extra ETH can then be stolen by an attacker.

## Vulnerability Detail

The LMPVaultRouter inherits from LMPVaultRouterBase, which exposes the functions `deposit` and `mint` where a user can deposit assets to an LMPVault.

Both functions use `_processEthIn` which will wrap `msg.value` to WETH, in case the user wants to use native ETH:
```solidity
function _processEthIn(ILMPVault vault) internal {
    // if any eth sent, wrap it first
    if (msg.value > 0) {
        // if asset is not weth, revert
        if (address(vault.asset()) != address(weth9)) {
            revert InvalidAsset();
        }

        // wrap eth
        weth9.deposit{ value: msg.value }();
    }
}
```
But after this call, the functions will still try to pull the tokens from the user (which would be WETH):
```solidity
IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
pullToken(vaultAsset, amount, address(this));
```
As a result, if the user sends ETH, they will be charged twice, once in ETH, once in WETH. Only the specific amount will be used and so extra WETH will stay in the contract.

The contract also inherits from PaymentPeriphery, which would allow an attacker to immediately pull the extra WETH from the contract after such as a mistake, using `sweepToken`:

```solidity
function sweepToken(IERC20 token, uint256 amountMinimum, address recipient) public payable {
    uint256 balanceToken = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balanceToken < amountMinimum) revert InsufficientToken();

    if (balanceToken > 0) {
        token.safeTransfer(recipient, balanceToken);
    }
}
```

## Impact

The LMPVaultRouter will charge a user twice if ETH is used and the extra amount of WETH can be immediately stolen by an attacker, resulting in a loss of user funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode

## Recommendation

The case of sending ETH should be correctly handled in `deposit` and `mint` by checking the balance of WETH or using some return value of `_processEthIn`.
