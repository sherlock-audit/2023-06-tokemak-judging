# LMPVaultRouterBase.mint tries to get payment 2 times in case of native payment
## Summary
LMPVaultRouterBase.mint tries to get payment 2 times in case of native payment
## Vulnerability Detail
`LMPVaultRouterBase.mint` is payable and user can [provide value with the call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L30).

In this case, payment will be [deposited to the weth](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L120).

But later, contract will [try to get funds again](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L34) and this [will fail](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/utils/PeripheryPayments.sol#L55) in case if user doesn't have allowance, or in case if it has, then he will loose funds.
