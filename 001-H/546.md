# `LMPVaultRouterBase` mint and deposit function unintended pulling WETH from user when using only ETH

## Summary

The `LMPVaultRouterBase` contract unintentionally takes WETH from users who send ether to mint/deposit.
Due to this, the excess WETH remains stuck in the router. Anyone can take these stucked WETH.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. When a user calls the `deposit()` function, which is a [payable method](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L43-L56), any ether (`msg.value`) is [converted to WETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L110-L121).

2. Simultaneously, the function [`pullToken()` fetches the `vaultAsset` (WETH) from the user](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L52-L54), which is WETH determined by [`LMPVault.asset()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L114-L116).

3. The issue arises as the `LMPVault` accepts WETH only from the amount pulled from the user, neglecting the ether the user sent to the payable function. Consequently, any unutilized ether remains stranded in the router contract.

4. Given the router contract's `PeripheryPayments` [sweep function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/utils/PeripheryPayments.sol#L57-L64), this stranded WETH can be taken by anyone.

## Impact

Router mint and deposit payable function does not process ETH transfered in to vault so `_processEthIn()` does nothing.
Any user use ETH to deposit/mint will be stucked in router contract and can be stolen by anyone.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Eliminate the payable attribute from the mint/deposit functions.
- Relocate `_processEthIn()` to an individual function and employ multicall for executing both functions in a single transaction.
