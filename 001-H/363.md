# Too many assets may be pulled from the user when they deposit or mint into the `LMPVault` via `LMPVaultRouterBase.mint()` or `LMPVaultRouterBase.deposit()`
## Summary

`LMPVaultRouterBase.mint()` and `LMPVaultRouterBase.deposit()` both may pull too many assets from the user, if the user sends ETH via `msg.value`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user is calling `LMPVaultRouterBase.mint()` or `LMPVaultRouterBase.deposit()` and they are sending ETH via `msg.value`, the protocol may pull too many assets from the user:

1. `LMPVaultRouterBase._processEthIn()` is called subsequently (line 51, line 30 LMPVaultRouterBase.sol), which deposits WETH for the `LMPVaultRouter` contract (line 120 LMPVaultRouterBase.sol) based on the `msg.value` which is the ETH the user sent to the contract.

1. Additionally `PeripheryPayments.pullToken()` gets called (line 54, line 34 LMPVaultRouterBase.sol), which transfers WETH from the user to the `LMPVaultRouter` contract, despite that the user already sent the necessary assets in ETH via `msg.value`.

## Impact

The protocol might pull too many assets from the user due to this issue. First the protocol receives ETH via `msg.value` and then additionally the protocol also pulls WETH from the user, so that the user might have paid too many assets at the end.

A malicious actor may then steal these excess assets by calling `PeripheryPayments.unwrapWETH9()`, which unwraps all the WETH in the `LMPVaultRouter` and sends it to the `recipient` function parameter, so that the malicious actor receives the excess WETH assets from the victim user who depositted or minted before into the `LMPVault` via `LMPVaultRouterBase.mint()` or `LMPVaultRouterBase.deposit()` by sending ETH to the protocol via `msg.value`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adjusting `LMPVaultRouterBase.mint()` and `LMPVaultRouterBase.deposit()` to account for the ETH that the user sent via `msg.value` to the protocol, so that the protocol doesn't pull too many assets from the user.
