# Incorrect handling of ETH when interacting with the `LMPVaultRouterBase.deposit()`
## Summary
Read the Detailed Description section 

## Vulnerability Detail
The purpose of the `LMPVaultRouterBase.deposit()` function is to facilitate the depositing of a specified `amount` into an ERC4626 vault, allowing the user to receive an expected minimum of `minSharesOut` shares in return.

```solidity=
function deposit(
    ILMPVault vault,
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 minSharesOut
) public payable virtual override returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
    // Handling possible ETH
    _processEthIn(vault);

    IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
    pullToken(vaultAsset, amount, address(this));

    return _deposit(vault, to, amount, minSharesOut);
}
```

At the beginning of the function, the internal function `_processEthIn()` is invoked to manage any ETH sent along with the function call. This internal function wraps the `msg.value` ETH into WETH if the designated LMPVault utilizes `WETH` as its `baseAsset`. However, a flaw arises where, even after wrapping the `msg.value` into WETH, the function still requires the sender to transfer the `amount` of WETH using the `pullToken()` function, rather than `amount - msg.value`. Consequently, this leads to a loss for the sender as the attached ETH remains unused.

A similar issue is also present in the `LMPVaultBase.mint()` function.

## Impacts
Senders could experience financial losses.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to modify the logic to ensure that users transfer `amount - msg.value` when the LMPVault utilizes WETH as its base asset.
