# User can not deposit ETH in LMPVault via router without being at loss
## Summary
`deposit()` function of the router collects ETH and WETH both while issuing the share for only one of them. If the user transfers eth and has also given the WETH approval for the deposit, the router will take both ETH and WETH, but it will only issue share for only one of them and in case user has only provided the ETH, the transaction will always revert because it will try to capture wETH as well which user has not approved of. Resulting in the user can only supply WETH to participate. 

## Vulnerability Detail

[`deposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L44) function of the `LMPVaultRouterBase.sol` tries to collect WETH and ETH from the user, with [`_processEthIn()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L51) Ether is deposited and then with [`pullToken()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L54) WETH is deposited.

```solidity
    function deposit(
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minSharesOut
    ) public payable virtual override returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
        // handle possible eth
        _processEthIn(vault);

        IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
        pullToken(vaultAsset, amount, address(this));
        return _deposit(vault, to, amount, minSharesOut);
    }

    function _processEthIn(ILMPVault vault) internal {
        // if any eth sent, wrap it first

            if (address(vault.asset()) != address(weth9)) {
                revert InvalidAsset();
            }

Due to this User can not deposit ETH in LMPVault via router without being at a loss, Consider the following scenario : 

1. Case 1: Alice Deposits only ETH
- In the first case, let's consider Alice who wants to deposit only ETH into the LMPVault. The process involves converting her ETH to WETH using the _processEthIn function, then these WETH tokens are sent to the Router contract.
- The problem arises in the next step when the `pullToken()` function is called. This function attempts to transfer the same amount of WETH tokens from Alice to the Router contract. 
- However, this transfer fails because Alice hasn't given approval to the Router contract to access her WETH tokens. Consequently, the deposit of ETH for Alice also fails, preventing her from depositing ETH alone.

2. Case 2: Alice Deposits both ETH and WETH (Same amount)
- In the second case, Alice tries to deposit both ETH and WETH (equal amounts) into the LMPVault. The process remains the same initially: her ETH is converted to WETH using _processEthIn, and the resulting WETH tokens are sent to the Router contract.
- Again, the pullToken() function is executed, and this time the transfer of WETH tokens from Alice to the Router contract succeeds. This is because Alice has granted approval for the Router contract to access her WETH tokens. However, despite the successful deposit, Alice encounters a different issue.
- The LMPVault calculates Alice's share based on either her deposited ETH or WETH. Consequently, she only receives a share equivalent to half of what she initially deposited (either in ETH or WETH). Additionally, Alice's funds become stuck within the Router contract
- This will happen when Alice has given a huge amount of WETH approval to the router previously and then she tries to deposit with ETH.

## Impact
The user won't be able to deposit ETH without incurring a loss, So DOS or loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Take isETH bool as the argument from a user specifying whether they want to supply ETH or not, then based on that separate the logic.
