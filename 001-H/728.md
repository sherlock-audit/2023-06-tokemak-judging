# User can lost funds during deposit() in LMPVaultRouter
## Summary
When depositing with ETH, **LMPVaultRouterBase**'s deposit() function can also pull WETH from caller if the caller had approved WETH back in some time. 

## Vulnerability Detail
1 - Alice wants to deposit 1 ETH to mint shares, as WETH and ETH are 1:1, so inside deposit() of LMPVaultRouterBase ```_processEthIn()``` converts deposited ETH into WETH. The functions will be called with params like below.
```solidity 
deposit(wethVaultAddress,userAddress,1e18,1e18)

```
2 - Assuming some users who have WETH and had approved to LMPVaultRouter back in some time. In spite of getting ETH, following line also pulls 1 WETH from user. 
```solidity
        pullToken(vaultAsset, amount, address(this));
```

3 - The user will get shares of 1 ETH, and user will lose 1 WETH unknowingly. 

The WETH pulled from user will remain inside the LMPVaultRouter unless someone/BOT calls sweepToken() and gets those WETH.

## Impact

Those users who have WETH in their account and had approved WETH to LMPVaultRouter will lose WETH when depositing with ETH.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
   /// @inheritdoc ILMPVaultRouterBase
    function deposit(
        ILMPVault vault,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minSharesOut
    ) public payable virtual override returns (uint256 sharesOut) {
        // handle possible eth
        _processEthIn(vault); // @audit

        IERC20 vaultAsset = IERC20(vault.asset());
        pullToken(vaultAsset, amount, address(this)); // @audit

        return _deposit(vault, to, amount, minSharesOut);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only pull WETH from user when msg.value < amount.
Make sure to pull the difference between msg.value and amount like below:
```solidity
if(msg.value < amount){
uint amountToPull = amount - msg.value;
pullToken(vaultAsset, amountToPull, address(this));
}
```
