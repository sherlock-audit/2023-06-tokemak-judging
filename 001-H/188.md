# LMPVaultRouterBase will charge a user 2x the deposit amount
## Summary
If a user uses ETH to mint/deposit in LMPVaultRouterBase, it will pull 2x the deposit amount from the user, while supplying him with 1x the tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
When using ETH in [LMPVaultRouter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouter.sol) to [mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L23-L41) or [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L44-L57) (bolt are in [LMPVaultRouterBase](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol)) it first [pulls](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L30) the ETH into the contract and then [pulls](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVaultRouterBase.sol#L34) the baseAsset (ex. WETH) with [PeripheryPayments](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/utils/PeripheryPayments.sol#L54-L56), where **recipient** is `address(this)` and **from** is `msg.sender`. However as you can see firstly ETH is pulled from this user and then WETH.

- If the user is lacking in WETH the TX will revert
- If he has enough WETH he will be charged twice for the same amount of tokens.

## Impact
User is charged 2x if he uses ETH to funds the Vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either remove the ETH method or make it in a way so that it pull the WETH from the contract.
