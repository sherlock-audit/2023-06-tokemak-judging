# Wrong implementation in router mint and deposit
## Summary
Mint and deposit in router is implemented wrongly resulting in 2 consequences

1. Native ether cannot be used to mint or deposit
2. User will double pay for minting or deposit

## Vulnerability Detail
Without loss of generality, we will describe this vulnerability with the mint function. The same issue is found in the deposit function.

`mint()` is made payable. Users can send in an amount of `ether` which will be wrapped into WETH when they want to mint shares. They can choose the amount of `shares` that they want to mint. The amount of assets needed to mint the shares is calculated by `previewMint()`.

Now, the issue here is that tokens are pulled from `msg.sender` regardless of the amount of `ether` that user has sent in. The amount pulled is always equal to exactly the amount needed to mint the shares. This means that no matter that no matter the amount of `ether` sent in and converted to WETH by the user, the router will still try to pull the same amount of WETH.

For eg, user wants to mint 100 shares which requires 5 assets. User sends in `5 ether`, but contract will still pull 5 WETH from the user if they have approved the router and have the required WETH. User is paying 10 ETH to mint just 100 shares.

## Impact
Because router is always trying to pull WETH from user regardless of the native ether token sent, users can potentially be double paying for their shares.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing `pullToken(vaultAsset, assets, address(this))` to `pullToken(vaultAsset, assets- msg.value, address(this))`
