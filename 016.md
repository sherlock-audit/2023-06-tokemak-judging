# queuedRewards are being lost due to incorrect logic

## Summary
`queuedRewards` are being lost inside `queueNewRewards`
## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever the system conducts the liquidation process at some point there will be a call to queueNewRewards.
If we will look what happens when its being called twice and both times it will be inside `queuedRatio < newRewardRatio` this means that `queuedRewards` are being **rewritten** while its supposed to be incremental until queuedRatio meets its goal or `block.number >= periodInBlockFinish`, which leads to lost rewards.

```solidity
    function queueNewRewards(uint256 newRewards) external onlyWhitelisted {
        uint256 startingQueuedRewards = queuedRewards;
        uint256 startingNewRewards = newRewards;

        newRewards += startingQueuedRewards;

        if (block.number >= periodInBlockFinish) {
            notifyRewardAmount(newRewards);
            queuedRewards = 0;
        } else {
            uint256 elapsedBlock = block.number - (periodInBlockFinish - durationInBlock);
            uint256 currentAtNow = rewardRate * elapsedBlock;
            uint256 queuedRatio = currentAtNow * 1000 / newRewards;

            if (queuedRatio < newRewardRatio) {
                notifyRewardAmount(newRewards);
                queuedRewards = 0;
            } else {
// @audit  its not being incremental, its just assigning which means all new ones will override previous
                queuedRewards = newRewards;
            }
        }

        emit QueuedRewardsUpdated(startingQueuedRewards, startingNewRewards, queuedRewards);

        // Transfer the new rewards from the caller to this contract.
        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);
    }
